Maestro includes a CLI tool (`maestro-cli`) for sending messages to agents, browsing sessions, running playbooks, managing settings, and controlling resources from the command line, cron jobs, or CI/CD pipelines. The CLI requires Node.js (which you already have if you're using Claude Code).

## Installation

The CLI is bundled with Maestro as a JavaScript file. Create a shell wrapper to run it:

```bash
# macOS (after installing Maestro.app)
printf '#!/bin/bash\nnode "/Applications/Maestro.app/Contents/Resources/maestro-cli.js" "$@"\n' | sudo tee /usr/local/bin/maestro-cli && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/maestro-cli

# Linux (deb/rpm installs to /opt)
printf '#!/bin/bash\nnode "/opt/Maestro/resources/maestro-cli.js" "$@"\n' | sudo tee /usr/local/bin/maestro-cli && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/maestro-cli

# Windows (PowerShell as Administrator) - create a batch file
@"
@echo off
node "%ProgramFiles%\Maestro\resources\maestro-cli.js" %*
"@ | Out-File -FilePath "$env:ProgramFiles\Maestro\maestro-cli.cmd" -Encoding ASCII
```

Alternatively, run directly with Node.js:

```bash
node "/Applications/Maestro.app/Contents/Resources/maestro-cli.js" list groups
```

## Usage

### Global Flags and Exit Codes

Two flags work on every command:

| Flag          | Description                                                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-q, --quiet` | Suppress incidental success output (errors still print). Never gates `--json`. |
| `--verbose`   | Print extra detail where available                                             |

Commands exit with a standardized code so scripts and CI can branch on the failure class:

| Code | Meaning                                                    |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`  | Success                                                    |
| `1`  | Generic / uncategorized failure                            |
| `2`  | Invalid usage (unknown flag, bad argument, nothing to do)  |
| `3`  | The Maestro desktop app is not running or not reachable    |
| `4`  | The running app does not support the command (older build) |
| `5`  | The app was reachable but did not respond in time          |

### Who Moves the View (`--background` / `--focus`)

Focus belongs to whoever is at the keyboard. An agent may create a surface; it should not decide you ought to be looking at it. Every verb that can move the Maestro view or raise a notice therefore accepts `--background`, which means exactly two things: the active agent does not change, and the active tab inside any agent does not change. The surface is still created and still addressable - it lands in the tab bar the way a browser opens a background tab.

Maestro's own system prompt tells agents to **pass `--background` by default** and to drop it only when you asked to be shown something. What follows describes what each verb does when the flag is absent, which is unchanged.

`--focus` is the opposite ask, and it ships on every one of these verbs even where it only names the current default. If both are passed, `--focus` wins.

**The flag is additive: one verb's default changed.** An unflagged call behaves exactly as it always has, except `refresh-auto-run`, which is now background by default because its old focusing default only ever pulled you away from the agent you were looking at.

| Command                     | Default when neither flag is passed         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `open-file`                 | switches to the file                        |
| `open-terminal`             | switches to the new terminal                |
| `open-browser`              | switches to the new browser tab             |
| `tab new`                   | switches to the new tab                     |
| `dispatch --new-tab`        | **background** (as it always was)           |
| `dispatch` (no `--new-tab`) | selects the target agent                    |
| `create-agent`              | selects the new agent                       |
| `create-worktree`           | selects the new agent                       |
| `switch-mode`               | switches the mode                           |
| `refresh-auto-run`          | **background** (`--focus` to switch)        |
| `refresh-files`             | **already quiet**; flag accepted, no effect |

`focus-agent`, `send --tab`, `open`, and `open-graph` exist _to_ move the view - you named that intent - so they take no placement flag. The graph in particular is a full-window overlay whose only effect is being looked at, so a background one would do nothing at all.

`switch-mode` is the one verb here that creates nothing: changing an agent's rendered surface is its entire effect, so there is no background surface to leave behind. `--background` there means "skip it rather than move me", and it only refuses when the target is the agent already on screen. Switching an off-screen agent changes no pixels and goes through normally.

`dispatch` is two verbs wearing one name. With `--new-tab` it creates a tab you will address by the id it prints, so it is background by default. Without it, it writes into an existing conversation and selects that agent, as it always has. `create-worktree --message` uses the same write path, and carries whatever placement you asked `create-worktree` for - so `--background` no longer creates the agent quietly and then yanks you onto it one message later.

`refresh-files` accepts `--background` and ignores it, because it never moved the view or said anything in the first place: the Files panel it refreshes is only drawn for the agent already on screen. That is deliberate rather than an oversight. The advice given to agents is "pass `--background` unless the user asked to be taken there", and an unknown option is a hard error - so one verb that refused the flag would turn a good habit into a failed command.

Errors ignore placement. A command that fails still raises its toast with `--background` set: the flag decides where a surface goes, not whether you get to hear that something broke.

### Sending Messages to Agents

Send a message to an agent and receive a structured JSON response. Supports creating new sessions or resuming existing ones for multi-turn conversations.

```bash
# Send a message to an agent (creates a new session)
maestro-cli send <agent-id> "describe the authentication flow"

# Resume an existing session for follow-up
maestro-cli send <agent-id> "now add rate limiting" -s <session-id>

# Send in read-only mode (agent can read but not modify files)
maestro-cli send <agent-id> "analyze the code structure" -r
```

The response is always JSON:

```json
{
	"agentId": "a1b2c3d4-...",
	"agentName": "My Agent",
	"sessionId": "abc123def456",
	"response": "The authentication flow works by...",
	"success": true,
	"usage": {
		"inputTokens": 1000,
		"outputTokens": 500,
		"cacheReadInputTokens": 200,
		"cacheCreationInputTokens": 100,
		"totalCostUsd": 0.05,
		"contextWindow": 200000,
		"contextUsagePercent": 1
	}
}
```

On failure, `success` is `false` and an `error` field is included:

```json
{
	"success": false,
	"error": "Agent not found: bad-id",
	"code": "AGENT_NOT_FOUND"
}
```

| Flag                 | Description                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-s, --session <id>` | Resume an existing session instead of creating a new one      |
| `-r, --read-only`    | Run in read-only/plan mode (agent cannot modify files)        |
| `-t, --tab`          | Open/focus the agent's session tab in the Maestro desktop app |

For desktop-handoff workflows (route the message through a desktop tab, return an addressable tab id, etc.) use [`maestro-cli dispatch`](#dispatching-to-a-desktop-tab) instead.

Error codes: `AGENT_NOT_FOUND`, `AGENT_UNSUPPORTED`, `CLAUDE_NOT_FOUND`, `CODEX_NOT_FOUND`, `MAESTRO_NOT_RUNNING`, `COMMAND_FAILED`.

Supported agent types: `claude-code`, `codex`.

#### Messages that start with a dash

Messages whose first character is a dash (em-dash `-`, en-dash `-`, double-dash `--`, minus `-`) collide with option parsing and will be rejected as unknown flags. Use the standard `--` end-of-options separator so the message is passed verbatim:

```bash
maestro-cli send <agent-id> -- " -  -  - revise the spec"
maestro-cli send <agent-id> -s <session-id> -- "--re-run"
maestro-cli dispatch <agent-id> -- "--force the rewrite"
```

Everything after `--` is treated as positional, so any flags you need must come before the separator. For `send` that's `-s`, `-r`, `-t` (`-t` is the boolean focus flag here); for `dispatch` it's `-t`/`--tab`, `--new-tab`, `-f`.

### Dispatching to a Desktop Tab

`dispatch` hands a prompt to an agent in the running Maestro desktop app and returns the tab/session id, so callers can address the same tab on follow-up calls without holding a persistent channel. Use this for orchestration use cases (Cue pipelines, external bots, multi-step automations).

```bash
# Dispatch to the active tab of an agent
maestro-cli dispatch <agent-id> "review the PR description"

# Open a fresh tab and dispatch the prompt into it
maestro-cli dispatch <agent-id> "start a new review pass" --new-tab

# Continue a previous dispatch by targeting its tab
maestro-cli dispatch <agent-id> "and now run the tests" -t <tab-id>

# Force a write to a busy tab (requires allowConcurrentSend=true)
maestro-cli dispatch <agent-id> "interrupt with this" -f
```

Output is always JSON. `sessionId` and `tabId` are the same value, duplicated so polling consumers can use either name:

```json
{
	"success": true,
	"agentId": "a1b2c3d4-...",
	"sessionId": "tab-xyz",
	"tabId": "tab-xyz"
}
```

| Flag             | Description                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--new-tab`      | Create a fresh AI tab in the target agent. Mutually exclusive with `-t` and `-f` (a new tab is never busy, so `--force` has nothing to bypass) |
| `--background`   | Leave the view where it is. Already the default with `--new-tab`; without it, suppresses the agent switch                                      |
| `--focus`        | Move the view to the target after dispatching                                                                                                  |
| `-t, --tab <id>` | Target an existing tab by id (from a previous `dispatch`). Mutually exclusive with `--new-tab`                                                 |
| `-f, --force`    | Bypass the busy-state guard. Gated by `allowConcurrentSend`; errors with code `FORCE_NOT_ALLOWED`. Cannot be combined with `--new-tab`         |

Error codes: `INVALID_OPTIONS`, `AGENT_NOT_FOUND`, `FORCE_NOT_ALLOWED`, `MAESTRO_NOT_RUNNING`, `SESSION_NOT_FOUND`, `NEW_TAB_NO_ID`, `COMMAND_FAILED`. `NEW_TAB_NO_ID` fires when the desktop app acknowledges `--new-tab` without returning a tab id, leaving callers nothing to chain follow-up dispatches against. Requires the Maestro desktop app to be running.

### Listing Sessions

Browse an agent's session history, sorted most recent to oldest. Supports pagination with limit/skip and keyword search.

```bash
# List the 25 most recent sessions
maestro-cli list sessions <agent-id>

# Limit to 10 results
maestro-cli list sessions <agent-id> -l 10

# Paginate: skip the first 25, show next 25
maestro-cli list sessions <agent-id> -k 25

# Page 3 of 10-item pages
maestro-cli list sessions <agent-id> -l 10 -k 20

# Search for sessions by keyword (matches session name and first message)
maestro-cli list sessions <agent-id> -s "authentication"

# Combine limit, skip, and search with JSON output
maestro-cli list sessions <agent-id> -l 50 -k 0 -s "refactor" --json
```

| Flag                     | Description                                        | Default |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `-l, --limit <count>`    | Maximum number of sessions to return               | 25      |
| `-k, --skip <count>`     | Number of sessions to skip (for pagination)        | 0       |
| `-s, --search <keyword>` | Filter by keyword in session name or first message | -       |
| `--json`                 | Output as JSON                                     | -       |

JSON output includes full session metadata:

```json
{
	"success": true,
	"agentId": "a1b2c3d4-...",
	"agentName": "My Agent",
	"totalCount": 42,
	"filteredCount": 3,
	"sessions": [
		{
			"sessionId": "abc123",
			"sessionName": "Auth refactor",
			"modifiedAt": "2026-02-08T10:00:00.000Z",
			"firstMessage": "Help me refactor the auth module...",
			"messageCount": 12,
			"costUsd": 0.05,
			"inputTokens": 5000,
			"outputTokens": 2000,
			"durationSeconds": 300,
			"starred": true
		}
	]
}
```

Currently supported for `claude-code` agents.

### Session Inspection

Inspect open AI tabs across the running Maestro desktop app and read their conversation history. Pair `dispatch --new-tab` (writes, returns a `tabId`) with `session show <tabId>` (reads, supports `--since` and `--tail`) to build a stateless poll loop without owning a persistent connection - used by Maestro-Discord and Cue follow-ups.

Both verbs talk to the running desktop over the same WebSocket as `dispatch`. There is no on-disk fallback: if the app is not running, the CLI exits with code `MAESTRO_NOT_RUNNING`.

#### List Open Tabs

Flatten every open AI tab across every Maestro agent into addressable entries:

```bash
# Default: compact text (one tab per line)
maestro-cli session list

# JSON for scripting
maestro-cli session list --json
```

Default text columns: `state` (`busy` / `idle`), star (`★` if starred), `tabId`, agent name + id, tab name, `createdAt` (relative). One tab per line so the output pipes cleanly into `grep`, `awk`, etc.

JSON envelope:

```json
{
	"success": true,
	"sessions": [
		{
			"tabId": "tab-1",
			"sessionId": "tab-1",
			"agentId": "a1b2c3d4-...",
			"agentName": "Backend",
			"toolType": "claude-code",
			"name": "Refactor parser",
			"agentSessionId": "claude-uuid-1",
			"state": "idle",
			"createdAt": 1714268000000,
			"starred": false
		}
	]
}
```

To extract just `tabId`s with `jq`: `maestro-cli session list --json | jq '.sessions[].tabId'`.

#### Show Conversation History

Print a tab's conversation log, with optional cursor (`--since`) and cap (`--tail`) filters applied desktop-side so the wire payload stays small even on long conversations.

```bash
# Default: formatted transcript (header + per-message blocks)
maestro-cli session show <tab-id>

# JSON for scripting
maestro-cli session show <tab-id> --json

# Only messages newer than an ISO-8601 timestamp
maestro-cli session show <tab-id> --since "2026-04-28T10:00:00Z"

# `--since` also accepts a bare epoch number (auto-detects ms vs sec by magnitude,
# so both `Date.now()` and `Date.now() / 1000` cursors work without a unit flag)
maestro-cli session show <tab-id> --since 1714268000

# Cap at the last N messages (applied after `--since`)
maestro-cli session show <tab-id> --tail 20

# Combine cursor + cap for poll loops
maestro-cli session show <tab-id> --since "$LAST_TS" --tail 50
```

| Flag                  | Description                                                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--since <timestamp>` | Only return messages strictly after this timestamp (ISO-8601, or epoch ms/sec auto-scaled) |
| `--tail <n>`          | Cap output to the last N messages (non-negative integer; applied after `--since`)          |
| `--json`              | Output as JSON (default is a formatted transcript)                                         |

JSON shape:

```json
{
	"success": true,
	"tabId": "tab-1",
	"sessionId": "tab-1",
	"agentId": "a1b2c3d4-...",
	"agentSessionId": "claude-uuid-1",
	"messages": [
		{
			"id": "log-1",
			"role": "user",
			"source": "user",
			"content": "Hello",
			"timestamp": "2026-04-28T10:00:00.000Z"
		},
		{
			"id": "log-2",
			"role": "assistant",
			"source": "ai",
			"content": "Hi there",
			"timestamp": "2026-04-28T10:00:01.000Z"
		}
	]
}
```

`role` is a coarse classification (`user` | `assistant` | `system` | `tool` | `thinking` | `error` | `unknown`) so conversational consumers can branch on intent; the raw `source` is preserved alongside for callers that need to discriminate further. ISO timestamps are emitted verbatim so a `messages[-1].timestamp` from one call can be fed directly back into `--since` on the next.

Error codes: `MISSING_TAB_ID`, `TAB_NOT_FOUND`, `INVALID_OPTION`, `MAESTRO_NOT_RUNNING`, `COMMAND_FAILED`. All errors are emitted as `{ "success": false, "error": "...", "code": "..." }` with exit code `1`.

### Pasted Images (`image list` / `image save`)

An image pasted into a Maestro chat reaches the agent as pixels in its context: the agent can see the screenshot, but it has no path to the file, so "save that to the repo" used to be a right-click only you could perform. These two verbs give the agent the same reach.

```bash
# What has been pasted, newest first
maestro-cli image list --limit 5
maestro-cli image list -a <agent-id> -t <tab-id> --json

# The most recent image, into the current working directory
maestro-cli image save

# By index (from `image list`) or by handle, to an exact path
maestro-cli image save 3 -o docs/screenshots/dashboard.png
maestro-cli image save 9ca2e320 -o assets/

# Every image in one conversation, into a folder
maestro-cli image save --all -t <tab-id> -o screenshots/
```

`image list` prints one image per line: index, handle, age, agent, tab, and the first line of the message it came in on.

| Flag                  | Command | Description                                                       |
| --------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-a, --agent <id>`    | both    | Only this agent (defaults to every agent)                         |
| `-t, --tab <tab-id>`  | both    | Only this AI tab                                                  |
| `--limit <n>`         | `list`  | Maximum images to show (default: 20)                              |
| `-o, --output <path>` | `save`  | File or directory to write (default: a generated name in the cwd) |
| `--all`               | `save`  | Save every image in scope instead of just the newest              |
| `--force`             | `save`  | Overwrite an existing file named by `--output`                    |
| `--json`              | both    | Output as JSON (for scripting)                                    |

Details worth knowing:

- **Scope it with `-a` / `-t`.** With neither, the scope is every agent, so "the newest image" is whatever was pasted most recently anywhere in the fleet. An agent saving its own conversation's screenshot should pass its own agent id.
- **The target is an index, a handle, or `latest`** (the default). A handle is the leading hex of the image's content hash, which is stable, so it keeps addressing the same picture as newer images push the indexes down.
- **The extension follows the bytes, not the name you asked for.** Saving a JPEG as `shot.png` writes `shot.jpg`, because an extension that lies about the encoding is a file every downstream decoder rejects. The path actually written is what the command prints.
- **Nothing is overwritten by accident.** A generated name that collides gets a `-2`, `-3` suffix; an explicit `--output` that already exists fails until you pass `--force`.
- **With `--all`, `--output` is always a folder** and is created if it does not exist, even when the scope happens to hold a single image.
- **The Files panel refreshes itself.** After writing, `image save` nudges the tree for whichever agents own the written paths, so the image appears without waiting for the panel's timed refresh (`--json` reports them as `refreshedAgents`). The nudge is best-effort: the bytes are already on disk, so a closed desktop is not a failed save.
- **Reads come from disk, not the running app**, so these work with the desktop closed. The cost is the renderer's two-second persistence debounce: an image pasted this instant may not be on disk yet, and `image save` says so rather than guessing.

Error codes: `AGENT_NOT_FOUND`, `NO_IMAGES`, `IMAGE_NOT_FOUND`, `AMBIGUOUS_IMAGE`, `IMAGE_MISSING`, `FILE_EXISTS`, `WRITE_FAILED`, `INVALID_USAGE`.

### Creating, Updating, and Removing Agents

Create, mutate, or delete agents directly from the command line. Requires the Maestro desktop app to be running.

```bash
# Create a Claude Code agent with a working directory
maestro-cli create-agent "My Agent" -d /path/to/project

# Create a Codex agent with custom model and environment variables
maestro-cli create-agent "Codex Worker" -d . -t codex --model gpt-5.3-codex --env API_KEY=abc123

# Create an agent with SSH remote execution
maestro-cli create-agent "Remote Agent" -d /home/user/project -t claude-code --ssh-remote <remote-id>

# Create an agent with all options
maestro-cli create-agent "Full Config" -d /workspace \
	-t claude-code \
	-g <group-id> \
	--nudge "Always write tests" \
	--new-session-message "You are a senior engineer working on project X" \
	--custom-path /usr/local/bin/claude \
	--custom-args "--verbose" \
	--env DEBUG=true --env LOG_LEVEL=info \
	--model opus \
	--effort high \
	--context-window 200000 \
	--provider-path /custom/provider \
	--ssh-remote <remote-id> \
	--ssh-cwd /remote/workdir \
	--auto-run-folder ~/playbooks/full-config

# Remove an agent
maestro-cli remove-agent <agent-id>

# Rename an agent
maestro-cli rename-agent <agent-id> "New Name"

# Move an agent into a group (use "none" to ungroup)
maestro-cli update-agent <agent-id> --group <group-id>
maestro-cli update-agent <agent-id> --group none

# Change an agent's working directory (refused while the agent process is running)
maestro-cli update-agent <agent-id> --cwd /new/path/to/project

# Combine both in a single call
maestro-cli update-agent <agent-id> --group <group-id> --cwd /new/path

# Edit the agent's settings - the same fields as the Edit Agent modal
maestro-cli update-agent <agent-id> --nudge "Always write tests"

```

`update-agent` mutates an existing agent in place, writing the same live desktop Session the Edit Agent modal edits (not the per-agent config store that `settings agent set` writes). Read the current values back with `maestro-cli show agent <id> --json`.

The group update reuses the same write path as drag-and-drop in the Left Bar. The cwd update moves the agent as a whole: the working directory, the project root the Files panel and Edit dialog read, and an Auto Run folder that lives inside the old directory all follow the new path (an Auto Run folder elsewhere is left where you put it). Provider conversations stored under the old path may not resume from the new one. Stop the agent before changing its cwd or SSH config; the underlying PTY's working directory and spawn target are fixed at launch time, so the renderer refuses those updates while the agent is busy or its process is alive and surfaces the reason on stderr. The remaining settings (nudge, messages, model, effort, env, token source, etc.) are spawn-time values and apply on the next launch, so they are accepted even while the agent is running.

For text fields, passing an empty string (for example `--nudge ""`) clears the field. `--env` replaces the environment map with the provided pairs; `--clear-env` empties it. `--context-window 0` (or `none`) clears the context-window override. `--token-source` only carries meaning for Claude Code agents: `api` uses `claude --print` (per-token API credit), `tui` drives the maestro-p TUI (Max-plan quota), and `dynamic` starts on the TUI and falls back to API when a usage window hits its limit. The `tui` and `dynamic` modes need the [maestro-p helper](https://runmaestro.ai/maestro-p/) on PATH; it is bundled locally, but for SSH remotes it must be installed on the remote host. See [Provider Notes](/provider-notes#token-source-max-plan-vs-api).

### Creating and Removing Groups

Manage Left Bar groups from the command line. Requires the Maestro desktop app to be running. Use a group ID with `create-agent -g` or `update-agent --group` to place agents into it, and `update-agent --group none` to move an agent back out.

```bash
# Create a group
maestro-cli create-group "Backend"

# Create a group with an emoji icon
maestro-cli create-group "Backend" -e 🔧

# Machine-readable output (returns the new group ID)
maestro-cli create-group "Backend" --json

# Remove an (empty) group
maestro-cli remove-group <group-id>

# Remove a group that still has agents (ungroups them first)
maestro-cli remove-group <group-id> --force

# Rename a group
maestro-cli rename-group <group-id> "Frontend"
```

Removing a group never deletes the agents inside it: the desktop ungroups any members (moves them to no group) and then removes the group. `remove-group` refuses a non-empty group unless you pass `--force`, so you don't accidentally scatter a populated group. Group IDs support partial-ID resolution.

`create-group` flags:

| Flag                  | Description                  | Default |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------- |
| `-e, --emoji <emoji>` | Emoji icon for the group     | -       |
| `--json`              | Machine-readable JSON output | -       |

`remove-group` flags:

| Flag          | Description                                               | Default |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `-f, --force` | Delete even if the group still has agents (ungroups them) | -       |
| `--json`      | Machine-readable JSON output                              | -       |

### Creating Worktree Agents

Branch a new agent off an existing parent agent into its own git worktree, without an Auto Run playbook. This mirrors the desktop "create worktree" flow: the parent agent must already exist in the running app, the desktop creates the worktree on disk and a child session linked to the parent, then hands back the new agent's ID.

```bash
# Create a worktree agent off a parent, on a new branch
maestro-cli create-worktree -a <parent-agent-id> -b feature/new-thing

# Base the new branch on a specific ref when it does not yet exist
maestro-cli create-worktree -a <parent-agent-id> -b feature/new-thing --base-branch rc

# Create the worktree and immediately dispatch an initial prompt to it
maestro-cli create-worktree -a <parent-agent-id> -b feature/new-thing -m "Start on the API layer"
```

The optional `--message` is delivered to the new agent as a plain prompt (not an Auto Run loop) on the same connection, addressed by the ID the desktop just returned. Both `--agent` and `--branch` support the usual partial-ID resolution.

| Flag                   | Description                                                                   | Default          |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `-a, --agent <id>`     | Parent agent ID the worktree branches from (required)                         | -                |
| `-b, --branch <name>`  | Branch name for the worktree, created if it does not exist (required)         | -                |
| `--base-branch <name>` | Ref the new branch is based on when it does not yet exist (e.g. `rc`, `main`) | parent repo HEAD |
| `-m, --message <text>` | Optional initial prompt dispatched to the new agent after creation            | -                |
| `--background`         | Create the agent without selecting it in the Left Bar                         | -                |
| `--focus`              | Select the new worktree agent after creating it (default)                     | -                |
| `--json`               | Machine-readable JSON output                                                  | -                |

### Driving the Workspace (Focus, Mode, Tabs)

Steer the desktop UI itself: focus an agent, flip an agent between AI and terminal mode, and manage an agent's AI tabs. These mirror clicking around the app and require the desktop app to be running.

```bash
# Focus (select) an agent in the Left Bar; optionally focus a specific tab
maestro-cli focus-agent <agent-id>
maestro-cli focus-agent <agent-id> --tab <tab-id>

# Switch an agent between AI chat and terminal mode
maestro-cli switch-mode <agent-id> ai
maestro-cli switch-mode <agent-id> terminal

# Open a new tab for an agent (optionally seed an AI tab with a prompt)
maestro-cli tab new -a <agent-id>
maestro-cli tab new -a <agent-id> --prompt "Start reviewing the API layer"

# Create the tab without taking the view from whoever is working
maestro-cli tab new -a <agent-id> --background

# Close, rename, star, or unstar a tab. The owning agent is resolved from the
# tab ID automatically, so you only need the tab ID (exact or a unique prefix).
maestro-cli tab close <tab-id>
maestro-cli tab rename <tab-id> "Docs"
maestro-cli tab star <tab-id>
maestro-cli tab unstar <tab-id>

# Flag a tab for the human with the unread dot, or clear it
maestro-cli tab unread <tab-id>
maestro-cli tab read <tab-id>

# Turn the tab's History synopsis on or off
maestro-cli tab save-to-history <tab-id> false

# Per-tab settings - the same switches as the composer chips. "active" means
# the tab on screen; add -a <agent-id> to say whose.
maestro-cli tab show active                     # read them all back
maestro-cli tab thinking <tab-id> sticky        # off | on | sticky | cycle
maestro-cli tab read-only <tab-id> true         # plan mode: no file writes
maestro-cli tab model <tab-id> opus             # "inherit" clears the override
maestro-cli tab effort <tab-id> high            # "inherit" clears the override
maestro-cli tab enter-to-send <tab-id> false    # "inherit" = global setting

# Move a tab in the tab bar (0-based index, or "first" / "last")
maestro-cli tab move <tab-id> first
maestro-cli tab move <tab-id> 2

# Pin an agent to the Bookmarks section at the top of the Left Bar
maestro-cli bookmark <agent-id>
maestro-cli unbookmark <agent-id>
```

`tab new` and `switch-mode` both take `--background` / `--focus`; see [Who Moves the View](#who-moves-the-view---background----focus). `switch-mode --background` refuses when the target is the agent already on screen, since the mode change _is_ the view change there, and tells you to re-run with `--focus` if you meant it anyway.

Find tab IDs with `maestro-cli session list`. `tab new` returns the new tab's ID (printed, or in the JSON payload with `--json`). Every verb that takes a `<tab-id>` also accepts the literal `active`, which resolves to the tab the agent currently has selected - `-a <agent-id>` says whose, and without it the CLI uses the agent the desktop has focused.

Bookmark, unread, star, and save-to-history are explicit set operations rather than toggles, so re-running a script lands on the same state either way. `tab thinking` is the one exception, and only in its `cycle` form, which advances one step the way clicking the chip does. Read the current values back with `maestro-cli tab show <tab-id>`, `maestro-cli show agent <id> --json` (field `bookmarked`), or `maestro-cli session list --json` (fields `starred`, `thinking`, `readOnly`, `model`, `effort`, `saveToHistory`, `enterToSend`, `active`).

`model`, `effort`, and `enter-to-send` are per-tab overrides: `inherit` clears the override so the tab follows the agent's model/effort or the global `enterToSendAI` setting again. That is not the same as `false` - `tab enter-to-send <tab-id> false` pins the tab to Cmd+Enter even when the global default is Enter. Agent-wide defaults still live on `maestro-cli update-agent <id> --model/--effort`. `bookmark` also has a flag form, `maestro-cli update-agent <id> --bookmark true`, for when you are already changing other agent settings in the same call.

### Listing Resources

```bash
# List all groups
maestro-cli list groups

# List all agents
maestro-cli list agents
maestro-cli list agents -g <group-id>
maestro-cli list agents --group <group-id>

# Show agent details (history, usage stats, cost)
maestro-cli show agent <agent-id>

# List all playbooks (or filter by agent)
maestro-cli list playbooks
maestro-cli list playbooks -a <agent-id>
maestro-cli list playbooks --agent <agent-id>

# Show playbook details
maestro-cli show playbook <playbook-id>
```

### Running Playbooks

```bash
# Run a playbook
maestro-cli playbook <playbook-id>

# Dry run (shows what would be executed)
maestro-cli playbook <playbook-id> --dry-run

# Run without writing to history
maestro-cli playbook <playbook-id> --no-history

# Wait for agent if busy, with verbose output
maestro-cli playbook <playbook-id> --wait --verbose

# Debug mode for troubleshooting
maestro-cli playbook <playbook-id> --debug

# Clean orphaned playbooks (for deleted sessions)
maestro-cli clean playbooks
maestro-cli clean playbooks --dry-run
```

### Running Documents Without a Playbook (`run-doc`)

`run-doc` runs one or more Auto Run `.md` documents directly, without saving a playbook first. Like `playbook`, it runs **headlessly** - it spawns the target agent itself and streams events, so it works whether or not the Maestro desktop window is open. This is the reliable way to execute a document an agent just wrote.

```bash
# Run a single document on an agent (by ID or name)
maestro-cli run-doc plans/frontend-plan.md --agent "Frontend"

# The path may be relative to the agent's Auto Run folder, relative to the
# current directory, or absolute. Multiple documents run in sequence.
maestro-cli run-doc plan-a.md plan-b.md --agent <agent-id>

# Wait for the agent if it is busy, loop until all tasks are done
maestro-cli run-doc plans/migrate.md --agent <agent-id> --wait --loop

# JSON output for scripting; skip history writes
maestro-cli run-doc plans/spec.md --agent <agent-id> --json --no-history
```

`run-doc` accepts the same execution flags as `playbook` (`--dry-run`, `--no-history`, `--json`, `--debug`, `--verbose`, `--no-synopsis`, `--wait`) plus `--prompt`, `--loop`, `--max-loops`, and `--reset-on-completion`. When no `--prompt` is given it uses the default Auto Run prompt.

> **`playbook` vs `run-doc` vs `auto-run --launch`:** use `playbook <id>` for a saved playbook and `run-doc <docs>` for raw documents - both run headlessly with no desktop dependency. `auto-run --launch` instead hands the run to the running desktop app (needed only when you want the run to appear and be controlled in the desktop UI).

> **`--agent` accepts a name:** the `-a, --agent` flag on these commands resolves an agent by ID (full or partial) **or** by display name. This lets a group-chat participant target itself with `--agent "<its name>"`.

### Prompt Customization

The CLI uses the same core system prompts as the desktop app. When you customize prompts via Settings → **Maestro Prompts**, those customizations are stored in `core-prompts-customizations.json` in the Maestro data directory and are automatically picked up by the CLI during playbook runs.

The prompts most relevant to CLI playbook execution are:

| Prompt ID               | Controls                                      |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `autorun-default`       | Default Auto Run task execution behavior      |
| `autorun-synopsis`      | Synopsis generation after task completion     |
| `commit-command`        | `/commit` command behavior                    |
| `maestro-system-prompt` | Maestro system context injected into sessions |
| `context-grooming`      | Context grooming during transfers             |

To customize these prompts, either use the desktop app's **Maestro Prompts** tab or edit the JSON file directly:

```text
# macOS
~/Library/Application Support/Maestro/core-prompts-customizations.json

# Linux
~/.config/Maestro/core-prompts-customizations.json

# Windows
%APPDATA%\Maestro\core-prompts-customizations.json
```

The file format is:

```json
{
	"prompts": {
		"autorun-default": {
			"content": "Your customized prompt content...",
			"isModified": true,
			"modifiedAt": "2026-04-11T..."
		}
	}
}
```

### Reading Prompts (`prompts list` / `prompts get`)

The CLI exposes Maestro's prompt registry directly so other agents can self-fetch reference material on demand. Parent prompts can use the `{{REF:name}}` directive (see [Prompt Customization → Include Directives](/prompt-customization#include-directives)) to expand into a one-line pointer; the agent then runs `prompts get` to retrieve the full content.

```bash
# List every available prompt id with description and category
maestro-cli prompts list

# JSON output for scripting
maestro-cli prompts list --json

# Print a specific prompt's content (honors user customizations)
maestro-cli prompts get _maestro-cli
maestro-cli prompts get autorun-default

# Include metadata in the response
maestro-cli prompts get _maestro-cue --json
```

`prompts get` returns the same content the desktop app would deliver, so customizations made via Settings → **Maestro Prompts** are reflected immediately. Bundled include fragments use a leading underscore in their id (e.g., `_maestro-cli`, `_history-format`); standalone prompts do not.

### Managing Settings

View and modify any Maestro configuration setting directly from the CLI. Changes take effect immediately in the running desktop app - no restart required.

```bash
# List all settings with current values
maestro-cli settings list

# List with descriptions (great for understanding what each setting does)
maestro-cli settings list -v

# Filter by category
maestro-cli settings list -c appearance
maestro-cli settings list -c shell -v

# Show only setting keys
maestro-cli settings list --keys-only

# Get a specific setting
maestro-cli settings get fontSize
maestro-cli settings get activeThemeId

# Get nested settings with dot-notation
maestro-cli settings get encoreFeatures.directorNotes

# Get with full details (type, default, description)
maestro-cli settings get fontSize -v

# Set a setting (type is auto-detected)
maestro-cli settings set fontSize 16
maestro-cli settings set audioFeedbackEnabled true
maestro-cli settings set activeThemeId monokai
maestro-cli settings set defaultShowThinking on

# Set complex values with explicit JSON
maestro-cli settings set localIgnorePatterns --raw '["node_modules",".git","dist"]'

# Reset a setting to its default value
maestro-cli settings reset fontSize
```

| `-v, --verbose`         | Show descriptions for each setting                      | `list`, `get` |
| `--keys-only`           | Show only setting key names                             | `list`        |
| `--defaults`            | Show default values alongside current values            | `list`        |

| `--raw <json>`          | Pass an explicit JSON value                             | `set`         |
| `--json`                | Machine-readable JSON output                            | all           |

<Tip>
Use `maestro-cli settings list -v` from inside an AI agent conversation to give the agent full context about every available setting and what it controls.
</Tip>

### Theme and Encore Features

Ergonomic, validated wrappers over the underlying settings, for the customizations users most often ask for by voice. Unlike `settings set` (which writes the settings file), these route through the running desktop app, so the change applies live. The app must be running.

```bash
# Switch the active theme by ID or display name (case-insensitive)
maestro-cli set-theme tokyo-night
maestro-cli set-theme "Catppuccin Mocha"

# See every available theme
maestro-cli set-theme --list

# Set how much light the app chrome catches (Settings -> Themes -> Surface Gloss)
maestro-cli gloss strong

# See the current level and what each one does
maestro-cli gloss
maestro-cli gloss --list

# List Encore (experimental) features and whether each is enabled
maestro-cli encore list

# Enable or disable an Encore feature
maestro-cli encore enable symphony
maestro-cli encore disable maestroCue
```

Encore feature IDs: `directorNotes`, `usageStats`, `symphony`, `maestroCue`. Friendly aliases are accepted (for example `group-chat` for `symphony`, `cue` for `maestroCue`).

Gloss levels, least to most: `off` (the shipped flat look), `sheen`, `strong`, `max`. Gloss only adds highlights and shadows to the sidebars, headers, tab bar and composer, so it changes no theme color and leaves text exactly as legible. It has no effect on light themes.

### Custom Theme Palette

`set-theme` only switches between built-in themes. The `theme` command group manages the user-configurable **Custom** theme palette (the same two settings the in-app Custom Theme Builder edits: `customThemeColors` and `customThemeBaseId`). Activate the result with `set-theme custom`.

```bash
# Print the current custom palette and its base theme (reads from disk; works offline)
maestro-cli theme show
maestro-cli theme show --json

# Export the custom theme as portable JSON (stdout, or to a file)
maestro-cli theme export
maestro-cli theme export --file my-theme.json

# Import a theme JSON file, apply it live, and activate it
maestro-cli theme import my-theme.json
maestro-cli theme import my-theme.json --no-activate   # save the palette without switching to it

# Set individual colors (key=value); optionally re-base from a built-in theme first
maestro-cli theme set accent=#ff0000 bgMain=#1a1a1a
maestro-cli theme set --base dracula accent=#ff79c6 --activate
```

Export files are byte-compatible with the in-app Custom Theme Builder, so a palette round-trips between the UI and CLI. `theme show` and `theme export` read the on-disk settings store directly (no running app required); `theme import` and `theme set` apply live through the running desktop app. Imports are validated the same way as the in-app importer: every required color key must be present and every value must be a valid CSS color.

| Command        | Flag                | Description                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `theme show`   | `--json`            | Machine-readable output                                    |
| `theme export` | `-f, --file <path>` | Write the theme JSON to this file instead of stdout        |
| `theme import` | `--no-activate`     | Save the palette without switching to the Custom theme     |
| `theme set`    | `-b, --base <id>`   | Initialize from a built-in theme before applying overrides |
| `theme set`    | `-a, --activate`    | Switch to the Custom theme after applying                  |

### Managing Agent Configuration

Each agent (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Factory Droid) can have its own configuration for custom paths, CLI arguments, environment variables, and model overrides.

<Info>
`settings agent set` writes the per-agent-type configuration store (defaults applied to newly created agents and headless CLI spawns). To change the settings of a specific existing agent shown in the Left Bar - its nudge message, model, env vars, Claude token source, and so on - use [`update-agent`](#creating-updating-and-removing-agents) instead, which writes that agent's live desktop Session.
</Info>

```bash
# List all agent configurations
maestro-cli settings agent list

# List config for a specific agent
maestro-cli settings agent list claude-code

# Get a specific agent config value
maestro-cli settings agent get codex model
maestro-cli settings agent get claude-code customPath

# Set agent config values
maestro-cli settings agent set codex contextWindow 128000
maestro-cli settings agent set claude-code customPath /usr/local/bin/claude
maestro-cli settings agent set codex customEnvVars --raw '{"DEBUG":"true"}'

# Remove an agent config key
maestro-cli settings agent reset codex model
```

| Flag            | Description                           | Commands      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `-v, --verbose` | Show descriptions for each config key | `list`, `get` |
| `--raw <json>`  | Pass an explicit JSON value           | `set`         |
| `--json`        | Machine-readable JSON output          | all           |

**Common agent config keys:**

| Key               | Type   | Description                                      |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `customPath`      | string | Custom path to the agent CLI binary              |
| `customArgs`      | string | Additional CLI arguments                         |
| `customEnvVars`   | object | Extra environment variables                      |
| `model`           | string | Model override (e.g., `gpt-5.3-codex`, `o3`)     |
| `contextWindow`   | number | Context window size in tokens                    |
| `reasoningEffort` | string | Reasoning effort level (`low`, `medium`, `high`) |

<Info>
Settings and agent config changes made via the CLI are automatically detected by the running Maestro desktop app. The app watches for file changes and reloads immediately - it's as if you toggled the setting in the Settings modal yourself.
</Info>

### Managing SSH Remotes

Create, list, and remove SSH remote configurations. These commands read and write directly to the Maestro settings file - no running desktop app required.

```bash
# List all configured SSH remotes
maestro-cli list ssh-remotes

# Create a new SSH remote
maestro-cli create-ssh-remote "Dev Server" -H 192.168.1.100 -u deploy

# Create with SSH config mode (uses ~/.ssh/config)
maestro-cli create-ssh-remote "Prod" -H prod-host --ssh-config

# Create with all options
maestro-cli create-ssh-remote "Build Server" \
	-H build.example.com \
	-p 2222 \
	-u ci \
	-k ~/.ssh/build_key \
	--env PATH=/usr/local/bin --env NODE_ENV=production \
	--set-default

# Remove an SSH remote
maestro-cli remove-ssh-remote <remote-id>
```

| Flag                    | Description                                                     | Default |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `-H, --host <host>`     | SSH hostname or IP (required; Host pattern with `--ssh-config`) | -       |
| `-p, --port <port>`     | SSH port                                                        | `22`    |
| `-u, --username <user>` | SSH username                                                    | -       |
| `-k, --key <path>`      | Path to private key file                                        | -       |
| `--env <KEY=VALUE>`     | Remote environment variable (repeatable)                        | -       |
| `--ssh-config`          | Use `~/.ssh/config` for connection settings                     | -       |
| `--disabled`            | Create in disabled state                                        | -       |
| `--set-default`         | Set as the global default SSH remote                            | -       |
| `--json`                | Machine-readable JSON output                                    | -       |

<Info>
SSH remote changes made via the CLI are detected by the running Maestro desktop app through file watching, just like settings changes.
</Info>

## Partial IDs

All commands that accept an agent ID, group ID, or SSH remote ID support partial matching. You only need to type enough characters to uniquely identify the resource:

```bash
# These are equivalent if "a1b2" uniquely matches one agent
maestro-cli send a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890 "hello"
maestro-cli send a1b2 "hello"
```

If the partial ID is ambiguous, the CLI will show all matches.

## JSON Output

By default, commands output human-readable formatted text. Use `--json` for machine-parseable output:

```bash
# Human-readable output (default)
maestro-cli list groups
GROUPS (2)

  🎨  Frontend
      group-abc123
  ⚙️  Backend
      group-def456

# JSON output for scripting
maestro-cli list groups --json
{"type":"group","id":"group-abc123","name":"Frontend","emoji":"🎨","collapsed":false,"timestamp":...}
{"type":"group","id":"group-def456","name":"Backend","emoji":"⚙️","collapsed":false,"timestamp":...}

# Note: list agents outputs a JSON array (not JSONL)
maestro-cli list agents --json
[{"id":"agent-abc123","name":"My Agent","toolType":"claude-code","cwd":"/path/to/project",...}]

# Running a playbook with JSON streams events
maestro-cli playbook <playbook-id> --json
{"type":"start","timestamp":...,"playbook":{...}}
{"type":"document_start","timestamp":...,"document":"tasks.md","taskCount":5}
{"type":"task_start","timestamp":...,"taskIndex":0}
{"type":"task_complete","timestamp":...,"success":true,"summary":"...","elapsedMs":8000,"usageStats":{...}}
{"type":"document_complete","timestamp":...,"document":"tasks.md","tasksCompleted":5}
{"type":"loop_complete","timestamp":...,"iteration":1,"tasksCompleted":5,"elapsedMs":60000}
{"type":"complete","timestamp":...,"success":true,"totalTasksCompleted":5,"totalElapsedMs":60000,"totalCost":0.05}
```

The `send` command always outputs JSON (no `--json` flag needed).

### Desktop Integration

Commands for interacting with the running Maestro desktop app. These are especially useful for AI agents to trigger UI updates after creating or modifying files.

#### Open a Maestro Surface (Modal or Dashboard)

Bring up one of Maestro's modals or dashboards in the running app, optionally on a specific tab. This is how an agent answers "where do I see X?" by _showing_ you rather than describing a menu path.

```bash
# Every openable surface, with its tabs and hotkey
maestro-cli open --list

# Open Maestro Cue
maestro-cli open cue

# Deep-link to a tab
maestro-cli open cue --tab scheduled
maestro-cli open settings --tab shortcuts
maestro-cli open usage-dashboard --tab cue
```

| Flag              | Description                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-t, --tab <tab>` | Deep-link to a tab within the surface                   |
| `--list`          | List every openable surface, its tabs, and its shortcut |
| `--json`          | Output as JSON (for scripting)                          |

Surfaces are addressed by id or alias (`usage`, `stats`, and `dashboard` all reach the Usage Dashboard). A `--tab` value matches either the tab id (`scheduled`) or its label (`"Scheduled Tasks"`).

On success the command also prints how to reach that surface by hand:

```
Opened Maestro Cue (scheduled tab) in Maestro.
You can also reach Maestro Cue yourself: press Alt+Q, or open the command palette and search "Maestro Cue", or click the lightning-bolt icon in the Left Bar footer.
```

That second line is the point: an agent should relay it, so opening a surface for you teaches you the hotkey instead of making you ask again next time.

Surfaces behind an Encore Feature that you have switched off (Cue, Symphony, Director's Notes, the Usage Dashboard) refuse to open and say so in a toast rather than silently doing nothing or turning your setting back on.

#### Open a File

Open a file as a preview tab in the Maestro desktop app. Without `--agent`, the owning agent is auto-detected by which agent's working directory the file lives in (longest-prefix match, most-recently-active wins on ties). Pass `--agent <id>` to target an explicit agent - the file must live inside that agent's `cwd`.

```bash
maestro-cli open-file <file-path> [-a <id>] [--background | --no-switch]
```

| Flag               | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-a, --agent <id>` | Target agent (defaults to auto-detect by file path's owning agent)              |
| `--background`     | Open the preview tab without changing anything currently rendered, on any agent |
| `--focus`          | Switch to the file after opening it (default)                                   |
| `--no-switch`      | Don't switch to the target agent, but still activate the tab there              |

`--no-switch` and `--background` are different asks, and this is the one command that offers both. `--no-switch` keeps the Left Bar selection where it is but still activates the new tab inside the target agent - so if you were already on that agent, your view still changes. `--background` changes nothing rendered anywhere. Passing both is fine; `--background` is strictly stronger and wins. If `--no-switch` is what you reached for, `--background` is probably what you meant.

#### Open a Browser Tab

Open a URL as a browser tab in the Maestro desktop app. Only `http(s)` URLs are accepted; scheme-less inputs like `localhost:3000` or `example.com:8080` are auto-prefixed with `https://`.

By default this **switches the UI** to the target agent and makes the new tab visible. Pass `--background` to create the tab without moving the user: the active agent is left alone and whatever tab they were looking at stays on screen. Either way the command prints the new tab's ID, which is the handle for `close-browser`.

```bash
# Open in the active agent (switches the UI to it)
maestro-cli open-browser https://docs.runmaestro.ai

# Scheme-less - gets https:// prepended
maestro-cli open-browser localhost:3000

# Target a specific agent
maestro-cli open-browser https://github.com/RunMaestro/Maestro -a <agent-id>

# Background tab - does not switch agents or change the visible tab
maestro-cli open-browser https://example.com/docs --background -a <agent-id>
```

| Flag               | Description                                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-a, --agent <id>` | Target agent by ID (defaults to the active agent)                |
| `--background`     | Create the tab without focusing it or switching the active agent |
| `--focus`          | Switch to the browser tab after opening it (default)             |

<Note>
	Agents doing research should always pass `--background` and then `close-browser` when finished. A
	foreground tab pulls the window away from whatever the user is doing, potentially mid-keystroke.
</Note>

#### Close a Browser Tab

Close a browser tab by the ID that `open-browser` returned. The owning agent is resolved from the tab ID, so no `--agent` is needed. Exits non-zero if no such tab exists, so cleanup scripts can tell a real close from a no-op.

```bash
maestro-cli close-browser <tab-id>
```

| Flag     | Description                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------ |
| `--json` | Output as JSON (for scripting) |

#### Open a Terminal Tab

Open a fresh terminal tab in the Maestro desktop app. The working directory must resolve inside the target agent's `cwd`; paths outside it are rejected.

```bash
# Open a terminal in the active agent's cwd with the default shell
maestro-cli open-terminal

# Custom cwd, shell, and tab label
maestro-cli open-terminal --cwd ./packages/api --shell bash --name "API tests"

# Start a dev server in a named terminal
maestro-cli open-terminal --name "Dev server" --command "npm run dev"

# Target a specific agent
maestro-cli open-terminal -a <agent-id> --name "Build watch"
```

| Flag               | Description                                                         | Default     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `-a, --agent <id>` | Target agent by ID (defaults to the active agent)                   | -           |
| `--cwd <path>`     | Working directory for the terminal (must be inside the agent's cwd) | agent's cwd |
| `--shell <bin>`    | Shell binary to use                                                 | `zsh`       |
| `--name <label>`   | Display name for the tab                                            | -           |
| `--command <cmd>`  | Command to run once the shell is ready                              | -           |
| `--background`     | Create the tab without moving the view (agent and tab stay put)     | -           |
| `--focus`          | Switch to the terminal tab after opening it (default)               | -           |

`--command` is stored as the tab's startup command, the same field the tab's right-click "Startup Command…" menu writes. The command runs as soon as the shell finishes loading its rc files, and it runs again if the tab is restarted or the app is reopened. That is what you want for `npm run dev`; for a one-shot command that should not come back, close the tab when it finishes, or use `send-terminal` instead.

The command prints the new tab's ID. Keep it: it is the handle for `send-terminal --tab`.

#### Run a Command in an Existing Terminal Tab

`open-terminal` makes a new terminal. `send-terminal` types into one that is already open, which is what you want to drive a shell the user is watching.

```bash
# Run something in the agent's active terminal
maestro-cli send-terminal "npm test"

# Target a terminal by the ID open-terminal printed, or by its tab name
maestro-cli send-terminal --tab <tab-id> "git status"
maestro-cli send-terminal --tab "Dev server" "npm run build"

# Stop whatever is running (Ctrl-C)
maestro-cli send-terminal --tab "Dev server" --control C

# Type the command but leave it unexecuted, so a human can read it first
maestro-cli send-terminal --no-enter "rm -rf ./dist"

| Flag                 | Description                                                  | Default                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `-a, --agent <id>`   | Target agent by ID                                           | active agent                |
| `--tab <id-or-name>` | Terminal tab ID, or its display name                         | the agent's active terminal |
| `--control <letter>` | Send a control character instead of a command (`C` = Ctrl-C) | -                           |
| `--no-enter`         | Type the command without pressing Enter                      | Enter is sent               |

Notes:

- A tab **ID** is matched across every agent, so an ID from `open-terminal` works without `--agent`. A tab **name** is matched only within the target agent, because names collide (three projects can each have a "Dev server").
- With no `--tab`, the agent's active terminal receives the command. If several terminals are open and none is active, the command fails rather than guessing.
- The terminal must have a running shell. A tab that has never been displayed has no shell yet: open it with `open-terminal --command` instead, or select it in the app first.
- Text is typed into the shell verbatim. If something is already half-typed at the prompt, your command lands on the end of it.

#### Read a Terminal Tab's Output

`send-terminal` types into a shell; `read-terminal` reads back what it printed. Without it the terminal is write-only from a script's point of view: `open-terminal --command "npm run dev"` is the right way to run a long-lived process, but nothing could observe whether it came up.

```bash
# Last 200 lines of the agent's active terminal
maestro-cli read-terminal

# Target a specific tab, by ID or by name
maestro-cli read-terminal --tab <tab-id>
maestro-cli read-terminal --tab "Dev server" --tail 50

# Run something, then read what it printed
maestro-cli send-terminal --tab "Dev server" "npm run build" && \
    sleep 5 && maestro-cli read-terminal --tab "Dev server"

# Structured output - `busy` tells you whether the command is still running
maestro-cli read-terminal --tab "Dev server" --json
```

| Flag                 | Description                          | Default                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `-a, --agent <id>`   | Target agent by ID                   | active agent                |
| `--tab <id-or-name>` | Terminal tab ID, or its display name | the agent's active terminal |
| `--tail <n>`         | Return only the last N lines         | 200                         |
| `--json`             | JSON output for scripting            | plain text                  |

`--json` returns `{ tabId, name, cwd, state, busy, totalLines, lines: [...] }`. `busy` is the useful one for automation: it distinguishes "the command finished and this is its final output" from "it is still running and there is more to come". `totalLines` is the size of the buffer before `--tail` truncation, so you can tell a complete read from a partial one.

Notes:

- Output is plain text. The scrollback comes from the terminal emulator, which has already interpreted the escape sequences, so there are no colour codes to strip.
- Reads are bounded on purpose. A `tail -f` tab can hold an enormous buffer, and the default cap keeps it from swamping the caller; reads are capped app-side regardless of `--tail`.
- The tab needs a live buffer. Terminals stay mounted once their agent has been on screen, but a tab belonging to an agent never visited since launch has nothing to read yet - select the agent once, then read.
- Tab resolution matches `send-terminal` exactly: an ID matches across every agent, a name only within the target agent.

#### List Open Terminal Tabs

Terminal tabs live in the desktop app, so this asks the running app rather than reading from disk.

```bash
maestro-cli list terminals              # every agent
maestro-cli list terminals -a <agent-id>
maestro-cli list terminals --json
```

Each row is `state | active-marker | tabId | agent | name | cwd`, with the startup command appended when the tab has one. `*` marks the agent's active terminal (the one `send-terminal` writes to by default).

#### Refresh the File Tree

Refresh the file tree sidebar after creating multiple files or making significant filesystem changes:

```bash
maestro-cli refresh-files [--agent <id>] [--background]
```

This one never disturbs you: it renders no notice and moves no selection, since the Files panel it refreshes is only drawn for the agent already on screen. `--background` is accepted and ignored, so an agent that passes it on every command does not get a usage error here.

#### Refresh Auto Run Documents

Refresh the Auto Run document list after creating or modifying auto-run documents:

```bash
maestro-cli refresh-auto-run [--agent <id>] [--background | --focus]
```

Unflagged (or with `--background`), this never moves the view: an agent already on screen is refreshed silently, and an off-screen one is left alone, since its documents are re-read the moment you switch to it anyway. `--focus` **switches to the target agent** and flashes the document count on screen. This is the one verb whose default is background, because a focusing refresh only ever moved you when you were looking at a different agent.

| Flag           | Description                                                                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--background` | Refresh without switching to the target agent, and without a flash (the default) |
| `--focus`      | Switch to the target agent while refreshing, and flash the count                 |

#### Notifications

Surface notifications in the running desktop app from any script, hook, or agent. Two delivery modes are available, both built on the same five-color design language so they feel unified:

- **Toast** - persistent notification that lands in the toast queue (top-right). Auto-dismisses by default. Use this when you want the user to see a result they may want to act on later, when an OS notification should also fire, or when the message benefits from being clickable to jump to a specific agent. Toasts can be made **sticky** with `--dismissible` so they require an explicit click to dismiss - use this for messages the user must acknowledge.
- **Center Flash** - momentary, single-slot center-screen confirmation that auto-dismisses (default 1.5s, max 5s). Use this for "I did the thing" feedback for a user-initiated action - clipboard acks, quick status nudges, brief success notes. Only one flash is visible at a time; firing a new one replaces the active one.

##### Color palette (shared by both)

Both commands accept `--color`, one of five canonical values:

| Color    | Looks like                  | When to use                                                         |
| -------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `theme`  | Active Maestro theme accent | **Default.** Generic confirmation with no semantic                  |
| `green`  | Success green               | Succeeded ("Build passed", "Tests green", "Deploy complete")        |
| `yellow` | Warning yellow              | Soft heads-up ("Quota at 60%", "Slow query detected")               |
| `orange` | Warm orange (`#f97316`)     | More emphatic warning ("Approaching context limit", "Quota at 90%") |
| `red`    | Error red                   | Failure / blocked ("CI failed", "Auth expired", "Sync error")       |

Pick `theme` when you don't have an opinion - the flash/toast will visually match whatever theme the user is running.

##### Toasts

```bash
# Default - themed, queue-based, auto-dismisses on the app's default schedule.
maestro-cli notify toast "Build" "Compiled in 3.2s"

# Pick a color and a custom timeout (in seconds, max 60).
maestro-cli notify toast "Tests" "All green" --color green --timeout 10
maestro-cli notify toast "Quota" "Approaching limit" --color orange --timeout 30
maestro-cli notify toast "Tests failing" "12 failures in auth.test.ts" --color red

# Sticky - user must click to dismiss. Cannot combine with --timeout.
maestro-cli notify toast "Action required" "Approve the PR before EOD" \
    --color red --dismissible

# Toast linked to an agent (clicking jumps to it).
maestro-cli notify toast "Auto Run done" "All tasks completed" --agent <agent-id>

# Jump to a specific AI tab inside the agent.
maestro-cli notify toast "Diff ready" "Switch to review tab" \
    --agent <agent-id> --tab <tab-id>

# Open a file in the agent's File Preview pane on click.
maestro-cli notify toast "Patch ready" "Open the diff" \
    --agent <agent-id> --open-file src/foo.ts

# Focus one of the agent's terminal tabs on click. The value is a tab id or
# its name; bare --open-terminal lands on the agent's active terminal tab.
maestro-cli notify toast "Dev server crashed" "Exit code 1" \
    --agent <agent-id> --open-terminal "Dev server"

# Open a URL in an in-app browser tab on the agent, or focus a browser tab
# that is already open (the id `open-browser` printed).
maestro-cli notify toast "Preview ready" "localhost:3000" \
    --agent <agent-id> --open-browser http://localhost:3000
maestro-cli notify toast "Docs updated" "Back to the page you had open" \
    --agent <agent-id> --open-browser-tab <browser-tab-id>

# Open an external URL in the system browser on click (outside Maestro).
maestro-cli notify toast "Run finished" "View logs" \
    --open-url https://example.com/logs

# Render an inline action link beneath the message body (separate from
# the body click). Useful for "view PR" style affordances.
maestro-cli notify toast "PR opened" "Auto Run completed" \
    --agent <agent-id> \
    --action-url https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42 --action-label "View PR"
```

| Flag                      | Description                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-c, --color`             | `green \| yellow \| orange \| red \| theme` (default: `theme`)                                      |
| `-t, --timeout <sec>`     | Auto-dismiss after N seconds (range: `(0, 60]`; omitted = app default)                              |
| `--dismissible`           | Sticky toast - no auto-dismiss, click to close. Mutually exclusive with `--timeout`                 |
| `-a, --agent <id>`        | Associate with an agent so clicking the toast jumps to it                                           |
| `--tab <id>`              | AI tab ID within the agent - clicking jumps to that tab. Requires `--agent`                         |
| `--open-file <path>`      | On click, switch to the agent and open the file in File Preview. Requires `--agent`                 |
| `--open-terminal [tab]`   | On click, focus a terminal tab on the agent (id or name; bare = its active one). Requires `--agent` |
| `--open-browser <url>`    | On click, open the URL in a new in-app browser tab on the agent. Requires `--agent`                 |
| `--open-browser-tab <id>` | On click, focus an existing in-app browser tab. Requires `--agent`                                  |
| `--open-url <url>`        | On click, open the URL in the system browser (outside Maestro)                                      |
| `--action-url <url>`      | Inline link rendered beneath the message body (separate from the body click - opens in browser)     |
| `--action-label <text>`   | Label for `--action-url` (defaults to the URL itself); requires `--action-url`                      |
| `--json`                  | JSON output for scripting                                                                           |

The body-click hierarchy is: the `--open-*` flags (mutually exclusive with each other) > `--agent` (+ optional `--tab`). A click on the body can therefore land on an AI tab, a File Preview tab, a terminal tab, an in-app browser tab, or the system browser. When the target tab has since been closed, the click still switches to the agent and says what was missing. `--action-url` is independent - it renders a separate inline link button and does not affect the body click.

##### Center Flash

```bash
# Default - themed, auto-dismisses after 1.5s.
maestro-cli notify flash "Deployed"

# Pick a color. Use --timeout in seconds (max 5).
maestro-cli notify flash "Tests passed" --color green
maestro-cli notify flash "Production deploy starting" --color orange --detail "v1.42.0"
maestro-cli notify flash "CI failed on main" --color red --timeout 5

# Add a second line of detail.
maestro-cli notify flash "Cache cleared" --detail "1.2 GB freed" --timeout 3
```

| Flag            | Description                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-c, --color`   | `green \| yellow \| orange \| red \| theme` (default: `theme`) |
| `-D, --detail`  | Optional mono-font second line shown beneath the message       |
| `-t, --timeout` | Auto-dismiss after N seconds (range: `(0, 5]`; default 1.5)    |
| `--json`        | JSON output for scripting                                      |

##### Caps and dismissibility

External (CLI/web) callers are capped to **5 seconds** for Center Flash and **60 seconds** for Toast. The cap exists so external scripts can't stick a permanent overlay on the user. The only way to leave a notification on screen indefinitely is `--dismissible` on a toast - there is no equivalent for Center Flash (it is, by design, momentary).

Both commands support `--json` for scripting. Toasts respect the user's notification settings (audio feedback, OS desktop notifications) configured in the app.

### Configuring Auto-Run

Set up and optionally launch an auto-run session with one or more markdown documents. Documents must be `.md` files containing `- [ ]` checkbox tasks.

```bash
# Configure documents for auto-run
maestro-cli auto-run doc1.md doc2.md

# Configure and immediately launch
maestro-cli auto-run doc1.md doc2.md --agent <agent-id> --launch

# Add a custom prompt for the agent
maestro-cli auto-run doc1.md --prompt "Focus on test coverage"

# Save as a reusable playbook
maestro-cli auto-run doc1.md doc2.md --save-as "Auth Rewrite"

# Enable looping (re-run documents after completion)
maestro-cli auto-run doc1.md --loop --launch

# Loop with a maximum number of iterations
maestro-cli auto-run doc1.md --loop --max-loops 3 --launch

# Reset task checkboxes on completion (useful with looping)
maestro-cli auto-run doc1.md --reset-on-completion --loop --launch

# Run the auto-run inside a fresh git worktree on a dedicated branch
maestro-cli auto-run doc1.md --agent <agent-id> --launch \
  --worktree --branch feature/auto-x --worktree-path ../repo-auto-x

# Open a PR against the repo's default branch when the auto-run finishes
maestro-cli auto-run doc1.md --agent <agent-id> --launch \
  --worktree --branch feature/auto-x --worktree-path ../repo-auto-x \
  --create-pr

# Target a specific base branch for the PR
maestro-cli auto-run doc1.md --agent <agent-id> --launch \
  --worktree --branch feature/auto-x --worktree-path ../repo-auto-x \
  --create-pr --pr-target-branch develop
```

| Flag                          | Description                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-a, --agent <id>`            | Target agent to run the documents (partial ID supported)                                        |
| `-p, --prompt <text>`         | Custom prompt/instructions for the agent                                                        |
| `--loop`                      | Enable looping (re-run documents after completion)                                              |
| `--max-loops <n>`             | Maximum number of loop iterations (implies `--loop`)                                            |
| `--save-as <name>`            | Save the configuration as a named playbook                                                      |
| `--launch`                    | Immediately start the auto-run after configuring                                                |
| `--reset-on-completion`       | Reset task checkboxes when documents complete                                                   |
| `--worktree`                  | Run the auto-run inside a git worktree (requires `--launch`, `--branch`, and `--worktree-path`) |
| `--branch <name>`             | Branch name for the worktree (created if it does not exist)                                     |
| `--worktree-path <path>`      | Filesystem path for the worktree (must be a sibling of the repo, not nested inside it)          |
| `--create-pr`                 | Open a GitHub PR when the auto-run completes successfully                                       |
| `--pr-target-branch <branch>` | Target branch for the PR (defaults to the repo's default branch)                                |

Worktree mode reuses the desktop app's Auto Run pipeline: the app creates the
worktree (or reuses an existing one on the same repo), checks out the requested
branch, dispatches the agent inside the worktree, and - when `--create-pr` is
set - runs `gh pr create` once the batch completes. See
[Git Worktrees](git-worktrees.md) for more on worktree behavior.

### Controlling a Running Auto Run

Once an Auto Run is going, these commands stop it or recover it from an error pause - the counterpart to launching with `auto-run --launch`. They require the desktop app to be running.

```bash
# Stop the active Auto Run for an agent
maestro-cli stop-auto-run -a <agent-id>

# When an Auto Run pauses on an error, choose how to proceed:
maestro-cli resume-auto-run -a <agent-id>   # clear the error and continue
maestro-cli skip-auto-run -a <agent-id>     # skip the failing document, continue with the next
maestro-cli abort-auto-run -a <agent-id>    # stop the run entirely

# Revert all completed [x] tasks back to [ ] in one document so it can re-run
maestro-cli reset-auto-run-tasks loop/step-1.md -a <agent-id>

# Delete a saved playbook (find IDs with "list playbooks -a <agent-id>")
maestro-cli remove-playbook <agent-id> <playbook-id>
```

The filename for `reset-auto-run-tasks` is relative to the agent's Auto Run folder; absolute paths and `..` traversal are rejected.

### Checking Status

Check if the Maestro desktop app is running and reachable:

```bash
maestro-cli status
```

Returns the app version, uptime, and connection status.

### Diagnosing Problems (`doctor`)

When a command isn't working, `doctor` runs a checklist covering the most common causes in one shot: the desktop app reachable, the running build's version vs. this CLI's, whether the running app understands newer commands, and whether configured SSH remotes are well-formed.

```bash
maestro-cli doctor
maestro-cli doctor --json
```

```
  ✓ Discovery file present - port 54748
  ✓ App process alive - pid 10510
  ⚠ Version match - App is 0.17.1 but CLI is 0.17.2. Rebuild/restart whichever is behind.
  ✓ WebSocket reachable
  ✓ App handles commands
  ✓ SSH remotes - 2 configured, all well-formed
```

The version and "App handles commands" checks catch the most common gotcha: a freshly-built CLI talking to an older desktop app that's still running. When the app is behind, new commands fail because their handlers don't exist in the running build - rebuild and restart the desktop app. The CLI surfaces this directly: a command the running app doesn't recognize fails fast with "The running Maestro app does not support the '...' command" instead of a generic timeout.

### Shell Completions

Generate a completion script for your shell and source it:

```bash
# zsh - add to a directory on your fpath, or source from ~/.zshrc
maestro-cli completions zsh > ~/.maestro-cli-completion.zsh
echo 'source ~/.maestro-cli-completion.zsh' >> ~/.zshrc

# bash
maestro-cli completions bash >> ~/.bashrc

# fish
maestro-cli completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/maestro-cli.fish
```

The script is generated by introspecting the live command tree, so regenerating it after a CLI upgrade picks up new commands and flags automatically. The full command list is also available as `maestro-cli reference` (Markdown or `--format json`); [docs/cli-reference.md](cli-reference.md) is generated from it via `npm run gen:cli-reference`.

## Cue Automation

Interact with Maestro Cue subscriptions directly from the command line.

### Listing Subscriptions

List all Cue subscriptions across all agents:

```bash
maestro-cli cue list

# JSON output (for scripting)
maestro-cli cue list --json
```

Shows each subscription's name, event type, agent, enabled status, and last trigger time.

### Scheduling Tasks

`cue schedule` is the command surface for anything time-driven: a one-shot reminder, a daily job, or a repeating check. It writes straight to the agent's `.maestro/cue.yaml`, so it works with the desktop app closed, and everything it creates shows up in the app under **Maestro Cue → Scheduled Tasks** (`maestro-cli open cue --tab scheduled`).

```bash
# One-shot, relative
maestro-cli cue schedule --in 20m --agent "Cyber Stocks" --prompt "Check the deploy status."

# One-shot, absolute (local wall clock or ISO-8601 with an offset)
maestro-cli cue schedule --at "2026-08-20 16:00" --agent Pedsidian --notify --sticky --message "Push the rc branch"

# Every weekday at 9am
maestro-cli cue schedule --daily-at 09:00 --days mon,tue,wed,thu,fri --agent Pedsidian --prompt "Draft the standup notes."

# Twice a day, every day
maestro-cli cue schedule --daily-at 09:00,17:30 --agent Neema --prompt "Sweep the inbox."

# Every 30 minutes
maestro-cli cue schedule --every 30m --agent "ODIN Market" --prompt "Poll the market feed."
```

Inspect and edit what is scheduled:

```bash
# Everything, across every agent
maestro-cli cue schedule --list

# Only the repeating daily jobs, as JSON
maestro-cli cue schedule --list --kind daily --json

# Move a task's fire time (pass the timing flag that matches its kind)
maestro-cli cue schedule --reschedule standup --daily-at 09:15

# Stop it firing without deleting it, then bring it back
maestro-cli cue schedule --pause standup
maestro-cli cue schedule --resume standup

# Delete it
maestro-cli cue schedule --cancel standup
```

| `--every <duration>`       | Repeating on an interval (1 minute to 7 days)                            |
| `--list`                   | List scheduled tasks across agents                                       |
| `--kind <kind>`            | Filter `--list`: `once`, `daily`, `interval`, `all`                      |
| `--reschedule <name>`      | Change when an existing task fires                                       |
| `--pause` / `--resume`     | Flip `enabled` without deleting the task                                 |
| `--cancel <name>`          | Delete a task                                                            |
| `-a, --agent <id-or-name>` | Target agent (required when creating; scopes the other modes)            |
| `-p, --prompt <text>`      | Prompt to send when the task fires                                       |
| `--notify` / `--sticky`    | Also raise a toast; `--sticky` keeps it up until dismissed               |
| `-m, --message <text>`     | Toast body (defaults to the label, then the prompt)                      |
| `-n, --name <name>`        | Custom subscription name (auto-generated when omitted)                   |
| `-l, --label <text>`       | Human-readable label shown in the app                                    |
| `--pipeline <name>`        | Pipeline to file the task under (default: `Tasks`)                       |
| `--grace-minutes <n>`      | One-shot only: how late a missed fire may still run (default 360)        |
| `--keep-on-failure`        | One-shot only: keep the task on disk after a failed run                  |
| `--json`                   | Output as JSON (for scripting)                                           |

Notes:

- `--in`, `--at`, `--daily-at`, and `--every` are mutually exclusive: a task fires once, on a daily clock, or on an interval.
- A task with both `--prompt` and `--notify` becomes two subscriptions sharing one fire time (`<name>-prompt` and `<name>-notify`).
- `--agent` is a hard scope on `--cancel`, `--reschedule`, `--pause`, and `--resume`. When one name exists on two agents the command refuses to guess and lists the candidates.
- One-shot tasks delete themselves from the YAML after they fire. Repeating tasks stay until you cancel them.

### Triggering a Subscription

Manually trigger a Cue subscription by name, bypassing its normal event conditions:

```bash
# Trigger a subscription
maestro-cli cue trigger <subscription-name>

# Trigger with a custom prompt (overrides the configured prompt)
maestro-cli cue trigger <subscription-name> --prompt "Deploy to staging only"

# JSON output (for scripting)
maestro-cli cue trigger <subscription-name> --json
```

| Flag                     | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-p, --prompt <text>`    | Override the subscription's configured prompt                        |
| `--source-agent-id <id>` | Identify the originating agent (populates `{{CUE_SOURCE_AGENT_ID}}`) |
| `--json`                 | Output as JSON (for scripting and CI/CD integration)                 |

The `--prompt` flag is especially useful for `cli.trigger` subscriptions, where the prompt text is available in the subscription's template as `{{CUE_CLI_PROMPT}}`.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Trigger a review pipeline after finishing work
maestro-cli cue trigger "code-review" --prompt "Review the changes in the auth module"

# Trigger a deploy from CI
maestro-cli cue trigger "deploy" --prompt "Deploy commit abc123 to production" --json

# Re-run a failed automation
maestro-cli cue trigger "lint-on-save"
```

## Director's Notes

Director's Notes is an Encore feature (`encoreFeatures.directorNotes`) that builds a unified history view across every agent in your fleet, plus an AI-generated synopsis of recent activity.

```bash
# Show recent unified history (last N days, default 7)
maestro-cli director-notes history -d 3

# Limit to user-initiated entries only
maestro-cli director-notes history --filter user -l 50

# Markdown output for piping into a doc
maestro-cli director-notes history -f markdown -d 1

# AI synopsis of the past day (requires the desktop app running)
maestro-cli director-notes synopsis -d 1
maestro-cli director-notes synopsis --json
```

| Subcommand | Flag                  | Description                                                              |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| both       | `-d, --days <n>`      | Lookback period in days (defaults to the app's Director's Notes setting) |
| both       | `-f, --format <type>` | Output format: `json`, `markdown`, `text` (default `text`)               |
| both       | `--json`              | Shorthand for `--format json`                                            |
| `history`  | `--filter <type>`     | Filter by entry type: `auto`, `user`, `cue`                              |
| `history`  | `-l, --limit <n>`     | Maximum entries to show (default 100)                                    |

`synopsis` requires the desktop app to be running; `history` reads from disk and works offline. If `encoreFeatures.directorNotes` is disabled, enable it first with `maestro-cli settings set encoreFeatures.directorNotes true`.

The provider follows the app's Director's Notes setting. By default that is "use the first available provider", so the desktop picks an installed agent when the run starts and `--json` reports which one actually ran. Pin it with `maestro-cli settings set directorNotesSettings.autoSelectProvider false`.

## Publishing Session Transcripts to Gists

Publish an agent's session transcript to a GitHub gist so you can share it with collaborators or attach it to a bug report. Routes through the running Maestro desktop app (which holds the live transcript) and uses the user's authenticated `gh` CLI under the hood.

```bash
# Create a private gist (default)
maestro-cli gist create <agent-id>

# Add a description
maestro-cli gist create <agent-id> -d "Auth refactor pairing session"

# Make it public
maestro-cli gist create <agent-id> --public -d "Repro for issue #1234"

# Publish one provider session instead of the agent's open tabs
maestro-cli gist create <agent-id> --session <session-id>
```

| Flag                       | Description                                                        | Default        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| `-d, --description <text>` | Gist description                                                   | -              |
| `-p, --public`             | Create a public gist (default private)                             | private        |
| `-s, --session <id>`       | Publish one provider session's transcript instead of the open tabs | the agent tabs |

Output is JSON with the gist URL on success:

```json
{ "success": true, "agentId": "a1b2c3d4-...", "gistUrl": "https://gist.github.com/..." }
```

### Publishing a headless session

Without `--session`, `gist create` publishes the transcripts of the agent's **open AI tabs** in the desktop app. Headless callers (chat bridges, playbooks, Cue pipelines, CI) run their conversations with `maestro-cli send -s <session-id>` and have no tab, so for them that publishes an unrelated conversation - and a gist is readable by anyone holding the URL.

Pass the same session id you sent with:

```bash
SESSION=$(maestro-cli send <agent-id> "..." | jq -r .sessionId)
maestro-cli send <agent-id> "follow-up" -s "$SESSION"
maestro-cli gist create <agent-id> --session "$SESSION"
```

The desktop app publishes that session and nothing else: it uses the open tab holding the session when there is one, otherwise it reads the provider's stored transcript (SSH remotes included). If the session cannot be found it fails with `GIST_CREATE_FAILED` rather than falling back to the open tabs. The response echoes `agentSessionId` so you can confirm what was published.

Requires the Maestro desktop app to be running and `gh` to be authenticated (`gh auth login`). Error codes: `AGENT_NOT_FOUND`, `INVALID_SESSION`, `MAESTRO_NOT_RUNNING`, `GIST_CREATE_FAILED`.

## Scheduling with Cron

```bash
# Run a playbook every hour (use --json for log parsing)
0 * * * * /usr/local/bin/maestro-cli playbook <playbook-id> --json >> /var/log/maestro.jsonl 2>&1
```

## Agent Integration

Maestro agents are automatically informed about `maestro-cli` through the system prompt. Each agent receives the platform-appropriate CLI invocation command via the `{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}}` template variable, which resolves to the full `node "/path/to/maestro-cli.js"` command for the current OS.

This means agents can:

- **Read settings** to understand the current Maestro configuration
- **Change settings** on behalf of the user (e.g., "switch to the nord theme", "increase font size")
- **Manage agent configs** (e.g., "set the Codex context window to 128000")
- **List resources** like agents, groups, and playbooks
- **Open files** in the Maestro file preview tab
- **Refresh the file tree** after creating or modifying files
- **Configure and launch auto-runs** with documents they create
- **Send messages** to other agents for inter-agent coordination
- **Discover Cue subscriptions** with `cue list` and **trigger automation pipelines** with `cue trigger`

When a user asks an agent to change a Maestro setting, the agent can use the CLI directly rather than instructing the user to navigate the settings modal. Changes take effect instantly.

The system prompt instructs agents to use `settings list -v` to discover available settings with descriptions, giving them full context to reason about configuration changes.

## Requirements

- At least one AI agent CLI must be installed and in PATH (Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode)
- Maestro config files must exist (created automatically when you use the GUI)
