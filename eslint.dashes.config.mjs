//
// A second, deliberately tiny ESLint pass that runs ONLY the em/en-dash rule,
// over the directories the main config puts in its global `ignores` block:
// `src/__tests__/**` and `scripts/**`.
//
// Why a separate config rather than widening eslint.config.mjs: a flat-config
// object whose only key is `ignores` is a GLOBAL ignore, and no later config
// entry can re-enable a path it excludes. Un-ignoring the tests would therefore
// mean scoping every recommended rule set away from them by hand, which changes
// lint semantics for thousands of files to gain one rule. This keeps the main
// config untouched.
//
// Worth guarding: when the dash cleanup measured the drift between `main` and
// `rc`, 250 of the 634 files that differed by dash characters alone lived under
// `src/__tests__/`. Tests are roughly 40% of the surface the rule exists to
// protect, and they were the part nothing was watching.
//
// Chained after the main pass in the `lint:eslint` npm script, which CI runs.
