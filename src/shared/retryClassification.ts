/**
 * Retry classification & backoff scheduling for Agent Resilience.
 *
 * When an agent turn fails with a recoverable upstream error, Maestro can
 * automatically resend the same prompt instead of making the user re-type it.
 * Two distinct failure modes get two distinct retry strategies:
 *
 *  - `'availability'` - transient upstream trouble (Anthropic/OpenAI/etc.
 *    "Overloaded", HTTP 529/5xx, "too many requests", rate-limit throttling).
 *    These clear on their own in seconds-to-minutes, so we use exponential
 *    backoff: 30s, 1m, 2m, 4m, 8m, 16m, then 30m repeating forever.
 *
 *  - `'token-exhaustion'` - the account's plan quota is depleted ("usage limit
 *    reached", "quota exceeded", "resets at …"). We POLL until it comes back:
 *    at 15s, then 60s, then once every 15 minutes for as long as the outage
 *    lasts, and exactly on the reset time when the error named one and it lands
 *    sooner than the next probe. A parsed reset is
 *    a hint about when to expect recovery, never the only moment we look - the
 *    account can be switched, the plan can roll over early, and the notice can
 *    name the wrong window. See {@link tokenExhaustionDelayMs}.
 *
 * This module is intentionally pure and dependency-free so it can run in either
 * the renderer or the main process. It classifies by MESSAGE CONTENT rather than
 * {@link AgentErrorType} because Maestro's taxonomy lumps plan-quota exhaustion
 * in with rate limits under `rate_limited` (while the `token_exhaustion` type
 * actually means the *context window* is full, which retrying can't fix).

 * or an already-switched account is most likely. Everything after that must be
 * SLOW: a plan quota comes back on a clock measured in hours, and probing it
 * every minute is hundreds of refused requests that tell us nothing.
 *
 * A doubling ramp looks like it covers both and does not. Ramping from 15s to a

/**
 * Delay before the next token-exhaustion attempt: a POLL, not a sleep.
 *
 * A depleted quota does come back on a clock, so the obvious implementation is
 * to parse the reset time and sleep until it. That is what this used to do, and
 * it is wrong in one direction that matters: it treats the provider's notice as
 * the only way the wait can end. It is not. The user can switch the agent to a
 * different account or provider, the plan can roll over early, the window named
 * in the message can be the wrong one, or the notice can simply be stale. A
 * single long sleep is blind to all of it - the observed failure was a 2h26m
 * outage that cleared "after 0 retries", meaning Maestro tried exactly once,
 * at the end, and had no idea what was true at any point in between.
 *
 * So we keep probing. Each probe is a real resend, because a real resend is the
 * only honest test of whether the quota is back - and it is nearly free when it
 * is not: the provider refuses before consuming tokens, and the outage card
 * updates in place rather than adding a transcript entry per attempt.
 *
 * Two rules:
 *
 *  1. **Never sleep past the expected reset.** When a reset time was parsed and
 *     it lands sooner than the next poll, wait exactly that long, so a known
 *     reset is met on the second rather than up to one poll interval late.
 *  2. **Otherwise poll on a fixed cadence**: 15s, 60s, then every 15 minutes for
 *     as long as it takes. The two early probes are quick because the first
 *     seconds are when a mis-parsed reset or an already-cleared limit is most
 *     likely; from the third probe on, the 15-minute floor keeps a four-hour
 *     outage to about sixteen refused requests per tab rather than 240.
 *
 * `attempt` is 0-indexed (0 = the first attempt of this outage).
