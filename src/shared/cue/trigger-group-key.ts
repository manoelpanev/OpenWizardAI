/**
 * Stable identity key for "subscriptions that represent one visual trigger."
 *
 * The pipeline-editor serializer emits fan-out to mixed or command targets as
 * multiple parallel subscriptions that each re-carry the full trigger event
 * config. Three places need the same notion of "same trigger" and must agree:
 *
 *  - `yamlToPipeline.ts` collapses matching subs onto one trigger node on load.
 *  - `cue-engine.ts` fires every sibling sub when the user clicks Play, so a
 *    manual run matches what a scheduled tick would do.
 *  - `SessionsTable.tsx` picks one representative per group for Run Now.
 *
 * They previously carried three hand-mirrored copies of this function, and the
 * two runtime copies had already drifted from the editor's (missing the
 * re-trigger fields), which let a manual Play fire subs a real tick would not
 * have grouped. One implementation, imported everywhere, removes that class of
 * bug: any divergence in event-specific config still yields a distinct key, so
 * genuinely independent triggers stay independent.
