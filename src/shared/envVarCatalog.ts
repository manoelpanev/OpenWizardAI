/**
 * Environment-variable name suggestions.
 *
 * Setting an env var on an agent is a two-step guess today: the user has to
 * remember the provider's exact spelling (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, not
 * `CLAUDE_HOME`) and type it without a typo, and a typo is silent - the
 * variable is set, the provider ignores it, and the agent behaves as if nothing
 * was configured. This module is the list the name field offers instead.
 *
 * Two sources feed that list, in this order:
 *
 *  1. **The provider's own catalog below.** Short on purpose: the vars people
 *     actually reach for (account dir, credentials, gateway, model), not every
 *     var the CLI reads. A list nobody can scan is a list nobody uses.
 *  2. **Names the user has already set**, anywhere in Maestro. Setting
 *     `HTTPS_PROXY` on one agent is the strongest possible signal that it
 *     belongs in the list for the next one, and it costs nothing to remember:
 *     the keys are already on disk in the agent configs, the sessions, and the
 *     global environment settings.
 *
 * The catalog is advisory. Anything can still be typed by hand, and a name
 * missing from here is not an error - it is a suggestion this module has not
 * been taught yet.
