/**
 * Typography presets - the two answers to "how should Maestro read?".
 *
 * Maestro was monospace everywhere until per-surface fonts existed, which is a
 * deliberate look rather than an oversight: it reads like a terminal. Now that
 * the interface, the terminal, the chat transcript, the file preview, the
 * document graph, and the file editor can each carry their own face, "which
 * font?" is six questions, and asking a new user six is worse than asking
 * none. A preset answers all six at once, and the individual pickers in
 * Settings -> Display stay available for anyone who wants to take them apart
 * afterwards.
 *
 * Shared rather than renderer-local so the preset the picker writes and the
 * preset the first-run modal writes cannot drift into two different definitions
 * of what "Hacker" means.
 *
 * Every field is written explicitly, including the empty ones. A preset that
 * omitted a surface would leave whatever the previous preset put there, so
 * switching Default -> Hacker -> Default would not round-trip.
