/**
 * focusPlacement - who gets to move the Maestro view, and how that is asked for.
 *
 * The rule this module encodes: **focus belongs to the human operator.** An
 * agent may create a surface; it may not decide the human should be looking at
 * it. A tab that opens in the background costs the human one click if they
 * wanted it. A tab that steals the viewport costs them their place mid-keystroke,
 * and they usually cannot tell which of thirty agents took it.
 *
 * `background: true` means exactly this, everywhere:
 *
 *   - the active AGENT does not change, and
 *   - the active TAB inside any agent does not change.
 *
 * The surface is still created and still reachable - it lands in the tab bar the
 * way a browser opens a background tab. "Created but invisible" is a different
 * bug and must never pass as background placement.
 *
 * ## `--background` is ADDITIVE. No verb's default changes.
 *
 * The defect being fixed is that an agent which wants to be polite has no way to
 * ask, on seven of nine verbs. It is NOT that the verbs focus. Every verb keeps
 * the behaviour it has today when the flag is absent, so no existing script,
 * playbook, Cue prompt, or muscle-memory invocation changes. The one exception
 * is `refresh-auto-run`, whose focusing default only ever interrupted (see its
 * entry in `CLI_BACKGROUND_DEFAULTS`).
 *
 * That makes the protocol rule dead simple, and deliberately so: **absent means
 * today's behaviour.** `readBackgroundField` therefore returns true only for a
 * literal `true`. Anything else - absent, null, `'yes'`, `1` - is not an opt-in.
 * Writing `!== false` anywhere in this path would invert that and silently stop
 * a verb from focusing, which is the single most likely way this change breaks.
 *
 * A future major can revisit making background the default. Shipping the flag is
 * the prerequisite either way: a default flip needs the escape hatch to already
 * exist. That is why `--focus` ships on every verb even where it currently
 * describes the default.
 *
 * ## Verbs that are allowed to move the view
 *
 * `select_session` (focus-agent, send --tab), `open_modal` (open) and
 * `open_document_graph` (open-graph) exist TO move the view - the caller named
 * that intent, and the graph is a full-window overlay whose only effect IS being
 * looked at, so "background" there would mean "do nothing". They are deliberately
 * absent from this table and must stay that way.
 *
 * ## Verbs that move nothing already
 *
 * `refresh-files` renders no notice and moves no selection - the panel it
 * refreshes is only drawn for the agent already on screen. It still ACCEPTS
 * `--background` (see `isAlreadyQuietVerb`) so the flag is safe to pass on every
 * verb an agent might reach for, which is what makes "pass --background by
 * default" teachable as one rule instead of a lookup table.
