/**
 * Effective environment for an agent process.
 *
 * An agent's environment is assembled from three layers that are each edited in
 * a different place, so "which profile am I actually running as?" is a question
 * no single settings pane can answer. This module does the same merge the
 * spawner does and reports WHERE each surviving value came from, which is the
 * part that makes the answer useful: seeing `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is only half
 * the story if you cannot tell whether it came from this one agent or from
 * every agent on the machine.
 *
 * Precedence (later wins), mirroring the agent spawner:
 *   1. global   - Settings -> Environment, applies to every process Maestro spawns
 *   2. session  - this agent's own vars, from Edit Agent, OR, when the agent has
 *      no vars record at all, agent: the provider-level set for its provider.
 *      Never both - the session record replaces the provider set.
