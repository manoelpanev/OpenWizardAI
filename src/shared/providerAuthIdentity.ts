 * token expires, it does not fail one agent - it fails all of them, and any Cue
 * pipeline they own, at the same instant.
 *
 * This module names that shared scope. It is the key everything auth-related is
 * grouped by: one prompt per provider rather than one per agent, and one list
 * of blocked agents to resume once the login succeeds.
 *
 * The scope is (agent binary, host). The host matters because an SSH remote has
 * its own credential store: the same agent can be authenticated locally and
 * expired on a remote, and re-authenticating one does nothing for the other.
 *
 * The second question this module answers is whether a login flow is the right
 * remedy at all. Not every credential is an OAuth login: an API key, a gateway
 * base URL, and a Bedrock/Vertex agent all fail with the same `auth_expired`
 * output, and none of them is repaired by running the provider's login command.
 * See {@link classifyCredentialKind}.
