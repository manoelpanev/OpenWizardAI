/**
 * Parquet Preview Types
 *
 * The wire contract between the main-process parquet query engine
 * (src/main/parquet/) and the renderer's ParquetViewer.
 *
 * Two rules shape this file:
 *
 *  1. **Bytes never cross IPC.** A parquet file can be gigabytes; the renderer
 *     only ever receives metadata and the window of rows it is displaying. The
 *     file itself stays behind an open file handle in the main process, read
 *     positionally a row group at a time. This mirrors how audio/video avoid
 *     the base64 path (see src/shared/mediaTypes.ts).
 *
 *  2. **Types live on the column, values are plain scalars.** Parquet is
 *     strongly typed, so the renderer learns a column is a timestamp / decimal
 *     / int64 exactly once, from {@link ParquetColumnInfo}, and every cell in
 *     that column arrives as a bare `string | number | boolean | null`. The
 *     alternative - tagging every cell with its type - multiplies a 500x60
 *     window by an object per cell for information that is constant down the
 *     column.
