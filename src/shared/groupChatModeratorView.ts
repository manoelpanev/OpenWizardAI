/**
 * Moderator-only view for a group chat.
 *
 * A room's transcript carries two conversations at once: the one the user is
 * having with the moderator, and the back-and-forth the moderator runs with the
 * participant agents on the user's behalf. Most of the time only the first one
 * is being read, and the delegations and agent replies bury it.
 *
 * The moderator-only view hides the second conversation in BOTH places it shows
 * up - the message list and the right panel's activity history - so the two can
 * never disagree about what "the chat" is. Nothing is deleted or stopped: this
 * is a display filter over data that is still logged in full, and flipping back
 * to the team view restores every message.
