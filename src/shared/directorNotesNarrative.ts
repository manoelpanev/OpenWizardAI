/**
 * Director's Notes structured narrative schema + parser.

 * half: the typed JSON structure the Director's Notes agent emits instead of a
 * markdown blob. Rich Mode renders this structure as styled `SectionCard`s; the
 * main-process IPC handler parses the raw agent output through here.
 *
 * `parseDirectorNotesNarrative` is the SINGLE source of truth for turning the
 * agent's raw string into a validated `DirectorNotesNarrative`. It never throws
 * and never guesses a partial structure: on any structural problem it returns
 * `{ ok: false, error }` with a precise message so the renderer can surface an
 * overt failure (raw output still reachable) rather than silently degrading.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free so it can be unit-tested in isolation (Phase 05) and
 * imported from both the main process and the renderer.

 * Rebuild a JSON object whose tail was cut off mid-stream or closed with the

 *
 * A synopsis run costs minutes of agent time and emits one very long single-line
 * object, so a response that dies partway through is the difference between a
 * readable report and nothing at all. Scan to the last COMPLETE nested container
 * (an item or a section object), cut there, and close the containers that are
 * still open. Cutting at a completed `}`/`]` is what makes this safe: it drops
 * any half-written string, dangling key, trailing comma, or wrong bracket along
 * with it.
 *
 * The scan is bracket-TYPE aware, and that is the whole point. A model that
 * writes `...}]}}` where the last `}` should have been `]` has produced a
 * complete report behind one wrong character, but a scanner that only counts
 * depth sees a balanced object and reports "nothing to repair" - so the strict
 * parser's error is all the user ever gets, for a report that is entirely
 * intact. A mismatched closer ends the scan and the last MATCHED container
 * becomes the cut site.
 *
 * `lossless` distinguishes the two very different shapes of damage. An agent
 * writing right up against its output limit, or fumbling one bracket while
 * closing up, finishes the whole structure and loses only punctuation: every
 * section and bullet is present, and the repair is pure syntax. That is a
 * COMPLETE report and must not be shown to the user as a damaged one. A cut in
 * the middle of the bullet list is the real thing - content is gone - and
 * `lossless` is false. Two conditions decide it: the discarded tail carries no
 * CONTENT (only whitespace and structural punctuation), and the frames left to
 * close are shallow enough that the last section had finished. Sitting inside a
 * section or its item list means the report stopped mid-list; sitting in
 * `sections` counts only when the agent was visibly writing closers, since an
 * agent that just stopped there still had sections coming.
 *
 * Returns `null` when the input is not damaged (the top-level object closes on
 * its own, so the strict path already had its shot) or when nothing completed.
