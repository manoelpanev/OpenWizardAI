/**
 * The first-run modal series - what Maestro shows a user once, and to whom.
 *
 * Four steps run back to back: pick your typography, pick your theme, choose
 * how Maestro stays current (release channel, crash reports, the CLI), then
 * learn that your agents can drive all of it themselves. Each is a decision or
 * a disclosure that only makes sense before the user has settled in, so each is
 * shown at most once.
 *
 * Every step carries its OWN seen flag rather than one flag for the series.
 * That is what let the updates step arrive after the others without re-showing
 * the steps a user already answered - and it is why the typography step keeps
 * working for anyone who dismissed it before the rest existed.
 *
 * Shared rather than renderer-local so the planner is testable without React
 * and cannot drift from the flags the settings store persists.
