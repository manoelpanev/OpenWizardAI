/**
 * Fence-aware scanning primitives for Auto Run documents.
 *
 * These live in `shared/` because BOTH Auto Run engines have to read a document
 * the same way: the desktop engine (`src/renderer/hooks/batch/`) and the CLI
 * engine (`src/cli/services/batch-processor.ts`, which cannot import from the
 * renderer). A playbook that paused at a different task depending on how it was
 * launched would be a genuinely confusing bug, so the walk and the task regexes
 * are defined once, here.
 *
 * The fence bookkeeping is the reason this is a shared function rather than an
 * inlined loop: every scanner (task counting, HITL gates, model hints,
 * human-step detection) must skip fenced code blocks, or a playbook that
 * DOCUMENTS the marker syntax triggers it. Hand-rolled copies of that logic
 * drift apart on the details - closing-fence length, tilde fences, CRLF.
