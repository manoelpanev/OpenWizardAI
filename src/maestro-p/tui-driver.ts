// Slim TUI driver for maestro-p.
//
// Spawns the Claude CLI under a PTY and exposes a minimal event stream the
// run-mode flow can consume. By design this module is NOT the source of
// truth for assistant output - that comes from the structured JSONL
// transcript Claude writes alongside its TUI. The driver's only jobs
// post-startup are:
//
//   1. Signal startup readiness once the input prompt indicator (› or ❯)
//      first appears in the ANSI-stripped rolling buffer. The indicator is
//      detected with an UNANCHORED regex because PTY output routinely
//      prepends \r cursor returns, so ^-anchored line matching misses it.
//   2. Detect quota-limit messages on the screen. This is the one signal
//      the JSONL doesn't carry - Claude emits the limit text only to its
//      terminal panel.
//   3. Surface every ANSI-stripped completed line via 'line' for the
//      --status mode /usage panel capture. Run mode ignores 'line' events
//      entirely.
//   4. Report 'api-billing' when the startup header says claude came up on
//      API Usage Billing instead of a subscription plan (see billing-mode.ts).
//
// Explicitly NOT implemented: spinner regexes, completion-via-spinner-stop,
// 'ready' re-firing after each response. Completion in run mode is the
// JSONL tailer's responsibility (stop_reason === 'end_turn').

// middle of their prompts, and in live trials against claude 2.1.261 a single
// 4 KB write lost 2-4 KB every time, even 1.5s after startup. Chunks well under
// the queue size, spaced so claude has read each one before the next lands,
// keep the queue near-empty. Run mode's prompt-echo check (prompt-echo.ts)

// claude re-renders its whole input editor on every keystroke batch, and that

// pushes one render past the 20ms interval - which is why 3.4 KB prompts still
