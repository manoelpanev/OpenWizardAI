/**
 * Query event write buffer.
 *
 * Replaces the previous one-write-per-event path on the `stats:record-query`
 * IPC channel. The renderer fires a recordQuery on every interactive turn
 * (and the auto-run path adds more on top); each fire used to do a single
 * `stmt.run()` against the stats SQLite DB. Under normal load that's many
 * synchronous writes per second on the main process's hot path.
 *
 * Mirrors the batching cadence already used elsewhere in the codebase
 * (logger 50ms, thinking-chunk 50ms - see commit `e475c0bad`):
 *
 *  - Auto-flush after FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS or when the buffer reaches BATCH_SIZE
 *  - Synchronous flush hook for app-quit so we don't lose buffered events
 *  - Single transaction per flush - better-sqlite3 wraps an arbitrary number
 *    of inserts atomically, so the per-event WAL + fsync overhead collapses
 *    into one
 *
 * The buffer is intentionally module-level (not a class). The IPC handler
 * calls `enqueueQueryEvent(db, event)`; main process registers
 * `flushQueryEventsSync()` on `app:before-quit`.
 *
 * See PR-B 1.5 and CLAUDE-PERFORMANCE.md §"Update Batching".
