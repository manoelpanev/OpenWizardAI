/**
 * Parquet Query Engine
 *
 * Answers "give me rows N..N+M matching this filter" against an open parquet
 * file without ever materializing the file, and reports honestly how much work
 * that took.
 *
 * The engine is built around three ideas, in descending order of how much they
 * matter:
 *
 *  1. **Pushdown.** The filter is compiled (see shared/parquet/pushdown.ts)
 *     into a conservative parquet-level predicate and handed to hyparquet as a
 *     `pruningFilter`. Row groups whose footer statistics, bloom filters, or
 *     page indexes prove they cannot match are eliminated before a single data
 *     page is fetched. `pruningFilter` is used rather than the plain `filter`
 *     option specifically because it prunes physical ranges *without* dropping
 *     individual rows, leaving row-level truth entirely to the residual pass
 *     below - so a bound that is merely conservative can never lose a row.
 *
 *  2. **Two-phase projection.** Within a surviving range, only the columns the
 *     predicate mentions are decoded first. Ranges where nothing matches never
 *     touch the wide columns at all, which is the common case for a selective
 *     filter over a wide table.
 *
 *  3. **A resumable match set.** Scanning stops as soon as the requested page
 *     is satisfied (or a time budget expires) and picks up from the same range
 *     next call. Paging through a filtered 100M-row file therefore costs one
 *     forward pass in total, not one pass per page.
 *
 * Match sets are cached per filter, not per (filter, columns), so showing or
 * hiding a column re-materializes a page instead of re-running the scan.

 * 8,192 rows of the 117-column file that started this was 1.7 GB in a single
 * window, and scanning it peaked at 3.36 GB against a 4.19 GB heap ceiling -
 * survivable on this machine, fatal on one with less headroom or against a
 * slightly wider file.
 *
 * So the window is sized from the footer, which reports uncompressed bytes per
 * column chunk and therefore bytes per row. Narrow tables still get the full
 * row window (fast); fat ones get proportionally fewer rows (safe). The row cap
 * remains as the ceiling for tables so narrow the byte budget would allow an
 * absurd window.
 *
 * 64 MB comes from measuring the file that caused the crash, not from taste.
 * Peak RSS for a full bare-term scan of it: 192 MB budget -> 2,907 MB, 96 ->
 * 2,268 MB, 64 -> 2,029 MB, 48 -> 1,974 MB, against a 4,192 MB heap ceiling.
 * The returns flatten below ~64 MB because the remaining footprint is not the
 * window at all - hyparquet caches a decode per column, so a 117-column scan
 * retains 117 of them regardless of how small each one is. Shrinking further
 * buys little and costs proportionally more round trips, so 64 MB is where the
 * curve levels off. Note also that parquet bytes UNDERSTATE JS heap: a decoded
