/**
 * Anonymous check-in ping for DAU/MAU measurement.
 *
 * Alongside the GitHub update check, we send a lightweight, best-effort POST to
 * runmaestro.ai so we can count distinct installs per day / per 30 days and see
 * which themes and platforms are in use. The payload is intentionally minimal - a
 * stable, randomly-generated install id, the app version, the active theme id,
 * and the OS platform + CPU arch. Nothing here fingerprints the machine or the
 * user: the id is a UUID we generate once and persist in userData, not a hardware
 * identifier, and platform/arch are coarse build-target buckets.
 *
 * This is gated by the same "check for updates" preference as the update check
 * itself (see the renderer's startup effect). If the user opted out, this is
 * never called.
 *
 * Everything here is fire-and-forget: it must never block the update check and
 * any failure (offline, 5xx, timeout, malformed id file) is swallowed silently.

 * move on. The caller is responsible for the opt-out gate.
 *
 * `theme` is the active theme id (e.g. `dracula`), resolved by the caller from
 * the settings store. It is optional and best-effort: a missing/empty value is
 * simply omitted from the payload rather than sent as null, and never blocks the
 * ping. `platform`/`arch` come straight from `process` and are always included.
 *
 * Unpackaged runs never ping. `app.getVersion()` reads the version out of the
 * application's package.json, and an unpackaged launch may have none in scope -
 * Electron then returns the version of the Electron binary itself, which lands
 * in the analytics as a bogus app version. The e2e suite launches
 * `dist/main/index.js` directly (a file, so no package.json), and gives each run
 * a throwaway data dir, so every run also minted a fresh install id. That put
 * hundreds of phantom one-shot "installs" on Electron version numbers into the
 * dataset. Developer machines and CI are not the install base; skip them.
