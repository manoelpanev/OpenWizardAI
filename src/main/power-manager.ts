/**
 * The kind of sleep a caller needs to prevent.

 * Per Electron's documentation:
 * - `prevent-app-suspension` - "Prevent the application from being suspended.
 *   Keeps system active but allows screen to be turned off."
 * - `prevent-display-sleep` - "Prevent the display from going to sleep."
 *
 * Nearly every caller wants the former. Background work needs the machine awake;
 * it does not need the panel lit. Ask for `prevent-display-sleep` only when a
 * human is meant to be looking at the screen.
 *
 * Why this distinction is load-bearing on macOS: a held display-sleep assertion
 * is how the OS decides a user is present. The Duet Activity Scheduler (dasd)
 * gates the whole discretionary maintenance tier on that signal, so an app that
 * holds one indefinitely stops Spotlight indexing, Photos analysis, XProtect
 * scans, database cleanups and software updates for as long as it runs. An
 * app-suspension blocker keeps timers firing without making that claim.
