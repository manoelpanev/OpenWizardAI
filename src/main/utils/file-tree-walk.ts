/**
 * Local file tree walker (main process).
 *
 * The renderer used to build the local file tree itself, recursing with one
 * `fs:readDir` IPC round-trip per directory. That is fine for a small project
 * and pathological for a large one: a 700-folder vault costs 700 sequential
 * round-trips, each of which has to be scheduled on a renderer main thread that
 * is also rendering a streaming agent transcript. The walk itself takes under
 * 100ms of real filesystem work, so the round-trips - not the disk - were the
 * entire cost, and the Files panel could sit on "Loading files..." for minutes.
 *
 * This module does the same walk in one call, mirroring what the SSH path
 * already gets from its batched `find` loader. `fs:directorySize` has always
 * walked the whole tree here in a single call, which is why the footer counts
 * appeared while the tree above them was still spinning.
 *
 * The traversal rules match the renderer's former implementation exactly:
 * ignore patterns, an optional root `.gitignore`, a depth cap, a soft entry cap
 * that folders are exempt from, and an always-visible `.maestro` subtree that
 * is loaded in full regardless of the cap.
