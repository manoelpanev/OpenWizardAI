 *
 * ## How the CUE series is counted
 *
 * Cue runs arrive from two places: `options.cueCounts`, read from `cue_events`,
 * and any CUE entries still sitting in the JSONL file from before those writes
 * were removed. Per bucket the series takes the LARGER of the two rather than
 * their sum, because in every bucket the two stores describe the same runs, not
 * different ones:
 *
 * - Before the cutover both writers saw each run, and the database set is a
 *   subset of the JSONL set (older rows predate the `output_excerpt` column, so
 *   only the failures among them pass the filter). Summing would double-count.
 * - After the cutover only the database has rows, so the max IS the database's
 *   count.
 * - Once Cue retention prunes a run, only the JSONL entry is left, so the max
 *   is the JSONL count.
 *
 * Two known imprecisions, both bounded to a single bar and accepted rather than
 * paying for row-level dedupe (which would mean loading every run's text):
 * the one bucket containing the cutover instant undercounts by whatever it held
 * before the cutover, and a run that starts in one bucket and finishes in the
 * next can be counted in both, since the database stamps dispatch time and the
 * JSONL entry stamped completion.
