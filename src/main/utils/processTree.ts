/**
 * Kill a process tree RIGHT NOW, with SIGKILL.
 *
 * No grace period and no SIGTERM first. Stop is an explicit, deliberate user
 * action on a command they have decided they do not want; making them wait out
 * a negotiation with a process that may never honour it is the wrong trade.
 * SIGKILL cannot be caught, blocked, or ignored, so this is the only way the
 * button can actually mean what it says.
 *
 * Three targets, because none of them subsumes the others:
 *
 *  - **Descendants**, snapshotted before anything dies (see collectDescendants)
 *    and killed deepest-last, so a parent cannot fork more while we work.
 *  - **The process group** (negative pid) - children that stayed in the
 *    parent's group, the common case for a plain `sh -c 'cmd'`.
 *  - **The pid itself**, NOT as an else-branch: `kill(-pid)` succeeding only
 *    proves *something* in that group was signalled, and an interactive shell
 *    with job control keeps itself in that group while the actual job runs in
 *    a new one.
 *
 * Killing descendants is not optional politeness: a `git push` whose pre-push
 * hook is running a test suite holds the pipes open through that grandchild, so
 * signalling only git leaves the run neither dead nor finished.
 *
 * Windows has no process groups in this sense, so `taskkill /t /f` walks the
 * tree instead. Synchronous there too, for the same reason.
 *
 * The cost of no grace period: a command killed mid-write (`npm install`, a
 * file copy) leaves whatever partial state it had. That is the accepted trade
 * for Stop being instant and certain.
