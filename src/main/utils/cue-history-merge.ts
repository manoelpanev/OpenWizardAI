/**
 * Cue-into-History merge helpers
 *
 * Cue runs stopped being written to the agent's JSONL history file in
 * CUE-HISTORY-02; they now live only in `cue_events` and are read back as
 * `HistoryEntry` rows by `getCueHistoryEntries()` in
 * `src/main/cue/stats/cue-stats-query.ts`.
 *
 * Two handlers have to fold those rows back into a history list - the History
 * panel (`ipc/handlers/history.ts`) and Director's Notes
 * (`ipc/handlers/director-notes.ts`) - and they must agree on every part of it:
 * which agents are in scope, how a database failure degrades, and which rows
 * the JSONL file already carries. This module is that shared half, so the two
 * surfaces cannot drift into showing different Cue activity for the same runs.
 *
 * Every query is passed in rather than imported. Both callers inject it for the
 * same reason: a static edge from a history handler to the Cue SQLite layer
 * would drag `better-sqlite3` (a native binding built for Electron's ABI) into
 * every consumer of these modules.
