 *

 * gating the entire mechanism, the previous global pin / per-tab manual pin
 * inputs are gone - selection is purely automatic, falling back to API when
 * the latest usage snapshot shows either the 5-hour or 7-day window at or
 * above `LIMIT_THRESHOLD_PERCENT`, and sticky-holding the fallback until both
 * windows have rolled over.
 *
 * No side effects. No I/O. Inputs are not mutated.
