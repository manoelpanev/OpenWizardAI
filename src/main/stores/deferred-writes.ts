/**
 * Deferred, cached store writes.
 *
 * `maestro-sessions.json` is the app's hottest store file and by far its
 * largest - one entry per agent, each carrying its tabs and the tail of every
 * tab's transcript. A user with dozens of agents runs a 5-10 MB file, and the
 * renderer flushes it every 2 s for the whole duration of any streaming turn
 * (see `useDebouncedPersistence`).
 *
 * electron-store makes that flush brutally expensive, and all of it lands on
 * the main process UI thread - the same thread that dispatches window input
 * events. One `sessions:setMany` costs:
 *
 *   1. `store.get('sessions')`  -> readFileSync + JSON.parse of the WHOLE file
 *   2. `store.set('sessions')`  -> readFileSync + JSON.parse again (conf reads
 *                                  the current document back before merging),
 *                                  then JSON.stringify + writeFileSync
 *
 * That is two full reads, two full parses, one full serialize and one
 * synchronous write per flush. On a 6 MB file that measured 69 ms on an idle
 * machine and 253 ms under load, repeating every couple of seconds. Keystrokes
 * are simply not delivered while it runs, which is why the app becomes
 * un-typeable during streaming while the mouse stays responsive (issue #1501).
 *
 * This module removes all four costs:
 *
 *   - **Read-through cache.** The document is parsed from disk once and kept in
 *     memory. Both reads and both parses disappear.
 *   - **Per-session serialization cache.** Sessions are serialized individually
 *     and memoized in a `WeakMap` keyed by the session OBJECT. The renderer and
 *     every main-process mutator update sessions immutably, so a changed
 *     session arrives as a fresh reference (cache miss) while untouched ones
 *     keep theirs (cache hit). The serialize cost becomes proportional to what
 *     actually changed rather than to the whole file.
 *   - **Async, coalesced write.** Writes are batched behind a short timer and
 *     go out as an async atomic write (temp file + rename), off the UI thread.
 *
 * Safe to cache because the main process is the sole writer of this file: the
 * app takes a single-instance lock, `maestro-sessions.json` is not watched, and
 * maestro-cli only ever READS it (it writes settings and agent-configs, which
 * are deliberately left on the synchronous path).
 *
 * The on-disk format is unchanged - the serializer reproduces conf's
 * tab-indented output byte for byte, so an existing file round-trips
 * identically and anything reading it by hand sees what it saw before.
