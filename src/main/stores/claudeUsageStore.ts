/**
 * Claude Usage Snapshot Store
 *
 * Singleton wrapper around an electron-store namespace that caches the latest
 * `maestro-p --status` snapshot per canonical `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` account. The
 * mode selector consults these snapshots whenever the per-agent Batch Mode
 * toggle is on to decide whether to fall back from interactive (Time Limits)
 * to API (API Limits) when the Max plan quota is exhausted.
 *
 * Snapshots expire 24 hours after `sampledAt`: past that they are no longer
 * returned by `getSnapshot` / `getAllSnapshots`, so no stale reading can decide
 * a fallback. They are still KEPT on disk for `SNAPSHOT_RETENTION_MS` and
 * returned by `getRetainedSnapshots()`, which is what the Usage Dashboard reads
 * - an account whose agents all moved away keeps its row and its last known
 * bars (flagged stale in the UI) instead of vanishing a day later.
 *
 * Pruning (beyond retention) is opportunistic - on read AND write, no
 * background timer - so the on-disk file stays clean even after long-quiet
 * periods, and corrupted records self-heal because an unparseable `sampledAt`
 * reads as beyond retention.
 *
 * The `Store` instance is created lazily on first method call so tests can
 * `vi.mock('electron-store')` before the module is touched.
