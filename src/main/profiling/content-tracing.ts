/**
 * Recording state machine around Electron's `contentTracing`, plus the buffer
 * watchdog that decides when a recording has to end.
 *
 * contentTracing is a process-global singleton: only one recording can be in
 * flight across the whole app at a time. This module owns that single bit of
 * state so the IPC layer and the renderer always agree on whether profiling is
 * active. Nothing here runs while profiling is off, so the feature has no
 * steady-state cost.
 *
 * ## The buffer watchdog
 *
 * Chromium records into a fixed per-process ring of `TRACE_BUFFER_SIZE_KB`.
 * When it fills, events are dropped, and NOTHING in the app or the resulting
 * file says so - the trace simply covers less time than the recording ran for,
 * and every question asked of it is silently answered from a fragment.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. Two field captures (Sep 2026) retained 22% and 43%
 * of their recordings. The guidance at the time was "keep captures short",
 * which asks a person to estimate trace-buffer pressure by looking at an app
 * window. Nobody can do that.
 *
 * So the buffer is polled while recording. Usage is reported live (the UI shows
 * it), and at {@link BUFFER_STOP_THRESHOLD} the watchdog calls the registered
 * auto-stop handler, which drives the same stop-and-save flow the user's own
 * "End Performance Profiling" does. The recording ends while its data is still
 * complete, instead of degrading into a fragment nobody knows to distrust.
