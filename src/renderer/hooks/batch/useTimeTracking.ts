/**
 * useTimeTracking - sleep-aware elapsed time for an Auto Run.
 *
 * Measures how long a run actually ran. The machine being asleep is subtracted,
 * because the agent really does stop; nothing else is.
 *
 * ## Why the window being hidden is NOT subtracted
 *
 * This hook used to pause on `visibilitychange` as well, on the theory that it
 * was measuring "active processing time". It was not. The agent is a separate
 * process: it keeps working whether or not the Maestro window is on screen, and
 * in Electron on macOS `document.hidden` goes true when the window is merely
 * minimized or fully covered by another app. So the clock stopped whenever the
 * user looked at something else, which on a long unattended run is nearly all
 * of it.
 *
 * That quantity is the USER'S ATTENTION, and it was being recorded as the
 * AGENT'S RUNTIME - into `auto_run_sessions.duration` (the Usage Dashboard's
 * "Longest Auto Runs" table) and into the leaderboard delta submitted at
 * completion. Measured on one real database: a run whose own task timestamps
 * span 22h 10m was recorded as 6h 52m, twenty-one runs recorded exactly zero,
 * and 71 hours went missing in total. The runs that read correctly were the
 * ones the user happened to sit and watch, which is precisely backwards - an
 * unattended overnight run is the one whose duration matters most.
 *
 * Note the badge/leaderboard tick in `useAutoRunAchievements` never had this
 * bug: it accrues on a 60s `sleepAwareElapsedMs` interval with no visibility
 * gate. That is why the local Conductor badge could show a 22h run that the
 * dashboard table had no row for.
 *
 * Sleep still needs its own signal: a system suspend never fires
 * `visibilitychange` (the window stays "visible" while the whole process is
 * frozen), so the gap comes from the main process via `systemSleep`.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Per-session time tracking
 * - Machine sleep subtracted from any session that was counting through it
 * - Proper cleanup on unmount

 * - Time accumulates for as long as the run is tracked, whether or not the
 *   Maestro window is on screen - see the note at the top of this file
 * - A machine sleep is subtracted by walking the active timestamp forward
 * - When stopTracking is called, the final accumulated time is returned
 *
 * `accumulatedTimeRefs` and the nullable `lastActiveTimestampRefs` are kept
 * even though nothing pauses a session any more: sleep correction writes
 * through the same timestamp, and the `onTimeUpdate` shape (which persists into
 * `BatchRunState.accumulatedElapsedMs` / `lastActiveTimestamp`, and from there
 * into state restored across a reload) is unchanged by this fix.
 *
 * Memory safety guarantees:
 * - Sleep subscription is removed on unmount
 * - Session tracking data is cleaned up when stopTracking is called
