/**
 * Bulk escape hatch for a stacked-up toast queue.
 *
 * Sticky (dismissible) toasts have no auto-dismiss timer, so a burst of them -
 * or a misbehaving integration firing them in a loop - leaves a wall of cards
 * that can only be cleared one close button at a time.
 *
 * Always offered, even with an empty queue. Unlike the media-player restore
 * command (which is a recovery affordance you only reach for while something is
 * playing), this is a command users go hunting for by name. Hiding it at zero
 * makes the search that should find it come back empty, which reads as "the
 * feature doesn't exist" rather than "there is nothing to clear". The count
 * lives in the subtext instead, and clearing an empty queue is a harmless no-op.
