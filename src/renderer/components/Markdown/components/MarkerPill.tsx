/**
 * The visible form of an Auto Run marker in a rendered document.
 *
 * Maestro's markers are HTML comments, so they render as nothing - which is
 * correct for the file and wrong for the reader. Two of the three do not just
 * change the next run, they stop it: a live HITL gate pauses every re-run until
 * a box is ticked, and a halt marker makes Auto Run refuse to start. Both of
 * those failures present as "I pressed Run and nothing happened", with the
 * cause sitting in text the panel does not draw.
 *
 * The pill states the EFFECT, not the marker name: "Pauses here" rather than
 * "HITL". Someone reading a playbook for the first time should not need to have
 * learned the vocabulary to understand why their run stopped.
 *
 * Color follows the five-color language used elsewhere in Maestro, chosen by
 * what the marker will do rather than by which marker it is:
 *
 * - **error** - a halt. The run will not start.
 * - **warning** - a live gate, or an unparseable setting. Something needs a person.
 * - **accent** - a model hint that governs the next dispatch, or a later one.
 * - **dim** - anything spent. Present in the file, doing nothing.
 *
 * A model hint that has not been reached yet keeps the accent hue and loses
 * some weight, rather than going dim. Dim is reserved for markers that are over
 * with, and a hint on a phase the run has yet to reach is the opposite of that:
 * it is the setting that phase is going to be dispatched at. Drawing the two
 * the same way made an upcoming `high` phase read as expired.
 *
 * Both foreground and background derive from theme colors, so the text runs
 * through `readableTextOn` - a theme whose warning sits near its background
 * would otherwise paint near-invisible text on a tinted chip.
