/**
 * An interactive GFM task checkbox in the rendered markdown preview.
 *
 * Shared by every preview that renders a task list: the file preview and the
 * Auto Run panel both mount it through `createMarkdownComponents`, which pairs
 * it with `rehypeSourceLine` to resolve the `- [ ]` marker's line.
 *
 * The box owns a short-lived optimistic state because the source of truth is a
 * file on disk: a click writes the document and the new `checked` prop only
 * arrives once the tab re-reads it. Without the local flip, React's controlled
 * input would snap back to the old value for the length of that round trip -
 * a visible bounce on a local file, a long one over SSH.
 *
 * `optimistic` clears whenever `checked` changes, so the moment the saved
 * document flows back in, the box is driven by the file again.
