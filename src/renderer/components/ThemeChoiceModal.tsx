/**
 * ThemeChoiceModal - the first-run "pick a look" step.
 *
 * Second in the series, after typography. Typography decides how Maestro reads;
 * this decides how it looks. Both are answered once, before the user has
 * settled in.
 *
 * Selection applies IMMEDIATELY rather than on confirm. A theme is a whole-app
 * visual change that no swatch can honestly preview at swatch size, so the
 * preview is the app itself - the modal repaints along with everything behind
 * it. That makes dismissal the interesting case: leaving without confirming
 * reverts to whatever was applied on open, so browsing costs nothing. Confirm
 * keeps what is on screen.
 *
 * There is deliberately no "Not now". A theme is always applied, so declining
 * is not available - whatever is on screen when this closes IS the answer, and
 * offering a decline button would imply an outcome where no theme is chosen.
 * The close button and Escape still work, and both mean "leave it as I found
 * it" rather than "no theme".
 *
 * Who sees it is decided by `planOnboardingSeries`, not here: a new user
 * always, a returning user only while still on the default theme. Anyone who
 * has already moved off Dracula found the picker on their own, and reopening
 * that decision uninvited would be presumptuous.
