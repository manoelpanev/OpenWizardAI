/**
 * AgentPowersModal - the last first-run step.
 *
 * The two steps before it hand the user a settings screen. This one tells them
 * they did not have to use it: an agent running in Maestro can drive Maestro,
 * through the same CLI the UI itself calls. That is the single least
 * discoverable thing about the app - nothing on screen suggests the chat pane
 * can rearrange the window around it - so it is stated once, plainly, at the
 * moment the user has just been shown two things they can change.
 *
 * Deliberately a disclosure and not a decision: no preset, no toggle, one way
 * out. It closes the series rather than adding to it.

 * shortcut for the two screens behind it rather than a door onto all of them.
 *
 * The two automation examples are split by what STARTS them, because that is
 * the distinction the app actually makes: a Scheduled Task is clock-driven
 * (`time.scheduled` / `time.once`), while a pipeline hangs off an event nobody
 * can predict the timing of. Giving both a wall-clock prompt would present one
