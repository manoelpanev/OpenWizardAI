/**
 * App-level owner of the one audio/video element.
 *
 * Mounted exactly once, near the root, and never unmounted. Media does not get
 * a file preview tab, a main panel view, or any other placement: opening an
 * audio or video file shows the floating player and nothing else. That is both
 * a product decision (a podcast should not cost the user their workspace) and a
 * technical one - anything rendered per-tab or per-agent is torn down on every
 * switch, and removing a media element from the document runs the HTML spec's
 * internal pause steps, killing playback.
 *
 * Exactly one player exists at a time, which makes overlapping audio
 * structurally impossible instead of a rule to enforce. Which file it holds
 * follows the user: opening one activates it, the transport's prev/next step
 * through the queue in open order, and the history menu jumps by recency.
