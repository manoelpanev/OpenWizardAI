/**
 * ReauthModal - re-authenticate a PROVIDER, and put its agents back to work.
 *
 * Scoped to the provider, not to the agent that happened to fail first. One
 * expired token blocks every agent sharing that credential store plus any Cue
 * pipeline they own, and one login fixes all of them - so this is one dialog
 * naming the whole blast radius, never one dialog per agent.
 *
 * It is deliberately loud and self-contained: the old recovery path only
 * dropped the user into terminal mode with the command still to type, which is
 * easy to miss when the failure happened overnight in a pipeline. Here the
 * login runs in an embedded PTY and finishes without leaving the dialog.
 *
 * Closing with "Resume agents" replays the turn each blocked agent died on
 * (see `resolveAuthOutage`), so the queued messages that piled up behind the
 * failure run in order without the user hunting for them.
 *
 * The account the login writes to is named up front in a pill. A provider can
 * hold several accounts at once (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME`) and the
 * wrong one is invisible until the login "succeeds" and the agent fails again,
 * so which account is in play is headline information, not something to go
 * looking for behind a disclosure.
 *
 * The PTY is a real terminal tab process (`process:spawnTerminalTab`), so the
 * provider's TUI, its device-code prompts, and SSH remotes all behave exactly
 * as they do in a terminal tab. The routing key carries `-terminal-` because
 * that is what makes PtySpawner forward raw output for xterm.js.
