/**
 * Pick the entries of a freshly-read transcript window that sit strictly BEFORE
 * what the tab already shows, so they can be prepended without duplicating
 * anything on screen.
 *
 * `loaded` is the newest N messages read from disk and `visible` is the tail of
 * that same conversation, so the splice point is wherever `visible[0]` appears
 * inside `loaded`. Two things stop that from being a plain `indexOf`:
 *
 * - IDs only line up when the tab was hydrated from disk. A tab that ran live
 *   and then survived a restart holds locally generated IDs for the same
 *   messages, so the comparison has to fall back to source + text.
 * - Text alone is ambiguous: a user who sends "continue" ten times produces ten
 *   identical entries. So search outward from where the splice point is
 *   EXPECTED to be - the two lists differ only by entries that never reached
 *   disk - and take the nearest match rather than the first or last in the array.
 *
 * Nearest-to-expected is not enough on its own, though. `expected` is only an
 * estimate, and it is off by however many renderer-only entries the tab holds
 * (system notices, outage markers). Shift the estimate past one repetition of a
 * repeated message and the nearest source+text hit is the WRONG occurrence,
 * which either drops genuine turns or re-prepends ones already on screen. So
 * candidates are ranked by how much corroborating evidence they carry, and the
 * scan returns the best tier it found rather than the first hit of any tier:
 *
 *   1. Matching id - unambiguous, the tab was hydrated from this same file.
 *   2. Same source and text AND the same timestamp - a disk-hydrated entry keeps
 *      the provider's timestamp verbatim, so this pins the exact occurrence.
 *   3. Same source and text, and the entry AFTER it lines up with `visible[1]`
 *      too - two consecutive matches is far stronger than one.
 *   4. Same source and text alone - the old behavior, kept as a last resort
 *      because a live tab's entries carry locally generated ids and renderer
 *      clock timestamps, and their next entry may be a renderer-only notice
 *      that was never written to disk.
