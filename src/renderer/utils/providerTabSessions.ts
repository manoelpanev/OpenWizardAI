/**
 * Provider Tab Sessions
 *
 * Per-provider parking for an AI tab's provider-specific state.
 *
 * A tab holds one live `agentSessionId`, and that value is a resume token only
 * the tab's current provider understands. Changing an agent's provider used to
 * resolve that by deleting every tab in the agent, which destroyed the user's
 * transcripts to avoid carrying one invalid field. Instead, park the outgoing
 * provider's values under `AITab.providerSessions` and restore the incoming
 * provider's, so switching away and back lands on the same conversation.
 *
 * The invariant, relied on everywhere `agentSessionId` is read (700+ sites):
 * the live fields ALWAYS belong to `session.toolType`, and `providerSessions`
 * never contains an entry for it.
