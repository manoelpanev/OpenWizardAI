/**
 * Media Item Helpers
 *
 * Media is not a document, so it never becomes a file preview tab. Opening an
 * audio or video file hands it to the floating player and nothing else: no tab
 * in the bar, no main panel takeover, no header. The player is the only surface
 * media ever appears on.
 *
 * That makes this module the owner of "what is a playable media file" and of
 * the play queue's ordering, shared by the open path (which diverts media
 * before a tab can be created), the playback store, and the player itself.
 *
 * The playability test is deliberately content-based rather than
 * extension-based. The main process only hands back a `maestro-media://` stream
 * URL for *local* files it can actually range-serve, so a `.mp4` opened over
 * SSH keeps the existing binary "download and open externally" path instead of
 * landing in a player that has no bytes to read.
