/**
 * Transcript preservation for snoozed tabs.
 *
 * A snooze can run for months. The conversation itself lives in the provider's
 * own directory (Claude Code's `~/.claude/projects/.../<id>.jsonl`, and the
 * equivalent elsewhere) and is subject to the provider's retention, so a tab
 * that comes back in six weeks can easily find its transcript aged out from
 * under it. Maestro therefore keeps its own copy for the duration of the snooze,
 * exactly as it does for starred sessions.
 *
 * These are thin fire-and-forget wrappers over the mirror IPC. Mirroring is
 * best-effort: it must never block or fail a snooze, a wake, or a dismiss. The
 * main process holds a mirror until every reason to keep it is released, so a
 * session that is both starred and snoozed survives losing either one.
 */
