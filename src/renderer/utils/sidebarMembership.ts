/**
 * Which agents the Left Bar is drawing.
 *
 * "Visible" here is Pedram's definition: drawn ANYWHERE in the scrollable list,
 * scroll position irrelevant. Expand/collapse, archive state, the text filter,
 * and the unread filter decide membership.
 *
 * These two predicates existed inline in `useSessionCategories` (which decides
 * what renders) and, in a subtly different form, in `useSortedSessions`. Cmd+[ /
 * Cmd+] had no copy at all, which is why it cycled agents that were not on
 * screen. Three builders for one list is how they end up disagreeing in ten
 * places, so the render path and the cycle now share one source of truth -
 * adding a match rule here fixes both at once rather than one of them.
 *
 * The "does this agent need attention?" half lives one level down in
 * `sessionAttention`, because the bell badge, the collapsed rail, and the
 * jump-badge projection ask it without a filter context. Add an attention rule
 * there, not here.
