/**
 * Publish the resolved typography onto `document.documentElement` as CSS
 * custom properties.
 *
 * This is what makes a font setting reach the whole app rather than only the
 * components that happen to thread a `fontFamily` prop down. Two classes of
 * surface could not be reached any other way:
 *
 *   - Anything that portals to `document.body`. Forty-seven components do, and
 *     `body` was pinned to a literal JetBrains Mono stack, so every context
 *     menu, tooltip, popover, and portalled modal ignored the interface font.
 *     The toast fix that preceded this was one instance of that bug; this is
 *     the general form.
 *   - Tailwind's `font-mono` utility, used in ~200 places for chips, hashes,
 *     paths, and inline code. It compiled to a hard-coded stack, so none of
 *     them followed the user's chosen monospace font. It now compiles to
 *     `var(--maestro-font-mono)`.
 *
 * Custom properties inherit through the document, so a portal at `body` level
 * resolves them exactly like an in-tree node. Every variable also carries a CSS
 * fallback, which is what renders during the first paint before this runs.
