/**
 * Media Playback Store
 *
 * State for the app's single audio/video player.
 *
 * Media never becomes a file preview tab. Opening an audio or video file adds
 * it to this queue and shows the floating player - that widget is the only
 * surface media appears on, and it can be dragged anywhere or minimized to the
 * Left Bar header without stopping playback. Nothing takes over the main panel,
 * so a podcast plays while the user keeps working.
 *
 * **Minimizing and closing are different things**, which is what `dismissed`
 * and `closeItem` express: minimizing (`dismissed`) only hides the widget and
 * playback carries on from the header pill, while closing releases the player
 * and the sound stops. A control that hides itself must not silently also stop
 * the audio, and a close button that only hid it would leave sound coming from
 * nowhere.
 *
 * Exactly one item plays at a time. Several can be queued, but only the
 * **active** one has a mounted player; the transport's prev/next move between
 * them, a finished item hands off to the next, and the history menu jumps by
 * recency. Switching pauses whatever was playing, which is what keeps two audio
 * streams from ever overlapping.
 *
 * The element itself lives in `MediaPlaybackHost`, mounted once in `App.tsx`
 * and never unmounted: removing a media element from the document runs the HTML
 * spec's internal pause steps, so anything that renders per-tab or per-agent
 * would kill playback on every switch.
 *
 * **Queue and history are two lists, not one.** The queue is what plays next,
 * in open order, and it survives a restart (via the `mediaPlayerQueue` setting,
 * along with the loaded item and every remembered position) so a half-listened
 * playlist is still there tomorrow. History is what was played, newest first,
 * and it is deliberately per-boot: a fresh session should not open onto a log
 * of last week's files. Because they outlive each other in opposite directions,
 * history holds whole items rather than pointers into the queue - removing
 * something from the queue must not rewrite what the user already heard, and
 * picking it out of history re-queues it.
 *
 * `maestro-media://` stream URLs are minted per boot, so only paths are
 * persisted; the player re-resolves the URL when an item loads.
 *
 * Float geometry is position plus a width **per kind**: the frame's height is
 * always derived from the media (audio has no picture, video wants its own
 * aspect ratio), so it is not a number anyone stores. See `mediaFloatGeometry`.
 *
 * Multi-window note: each renderer holds its own copy of this store, so on a
 * multi-window build two windows can each own a player.
