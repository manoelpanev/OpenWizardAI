/**
 * authOutageStore - one re-authentication prompt per PROVIDER, not per agent.
 *
 * Credentials are shared: thirty agents backed by `claude-code` all read one
 * credential store, so an expired token fails all thirty within seconds of each
 * other (plus every Cue pipeline they own). Reporting each failure on its own
 * would bury the user in thirty identical dialogs describing one problem with
 * one fix.
 *
 * This store collapses them. The first blocked agent on a provider opens the
 * prompt; every later one joins the same outage, which is what lets the modal
 * say "31 agents are blocked" instead of appearing 31 times. That roster is not
 * cosmetic - it is the work list for the resume below.
 *
 * On a successful login the outage RESOLVES, and resolving replays the turn each
 * blocked agent died on. Their queued messages were never burned (the execution
 * queue is held while a session is in the error state), so replaying the failed
 * turn lets the ordinary exit-to-dequeue chain drain everything that piled up
 * behind it. The user re-authenticates once and the board picks up where it
 * stopped, with nothing to hunt down by hand.
