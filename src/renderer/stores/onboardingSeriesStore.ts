/**
 * Runs the first-run modal series as a sequence rather than independent modals.
 *
 * Each step's own dismiss handler advances this store, so exactly one modal is
 * mounted at a time and the next opens only when the previous closes. The
 * alternative - every modal self-gating on its own flag - would open all of
 * them at once on a fresh install and stack them by z-index, which is how you
 * get a user answering the last question first.
 *
 * The store holds only the running sequence. Whether a step has been SEEN lives
 * in settings, because that has to survive a restart; this does not.
