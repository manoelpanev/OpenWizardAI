/**
 * retryStore - Agent Resilience auto-retry engine (renderer).
 *
 * When an agent turn fails with a recoverable upstream error and the agent has
 * resilience enabled, this store schedules an automatic resend of the exact
 * prompt instead of making the user re-type it. Two strategies (see
 * `shared/retryClassification.ts`):
 *   - availability  → exponential backoff 30s→30m, then every 30m.
 *   - token-exhaustion → wait until the parsed reset time, else 1h, then hourly.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *   - Keyed per `${sessionId}:${tabId}` so parallel tabs retry independently.
 *   - The prompt to resend is the exact `QueuedItem` + `ProcessQueuedItemDeps`
 *     snapshotted at dispatch time (see `noteDispatch`) and replayed through
 *     `agentStore.processQueuedItem` - same spawn path, so images and slash
 *     commands survive unchanged, across every provider.
 *   - Entry status is its own state machine: `'scheduled'` (timer pending) →
 *     `'in-flight'` (resend dispatched, awaiting outcome). Because agent-error
 *     events arrive before the process-exit event, a failed resend flips the
 *     entry back to `'scheduled'` before exit fires; so the exit listener
 *     clears an entry only when it is still `'in-flight'` (== clean completion).
 *   - Timers live at module scope (not React state) so re-renders never disturb
 *     a pending retry. Retries do NOT survive an app quit - intentional: a
 *     closed app should not silently burn quota/hours in the background.
