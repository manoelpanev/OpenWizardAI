/**
 * gitCommandRunStore - in-flight `git pull` / `push` / `fetch` runs.
 *
 * The run outlives its console. `GitCommandRunnerModal` is a VIEW over this
 * store, not the owner of the command: closing the modal leaves the push
 * talking to the remote, and reopening the same operation on the same repo
 * re-attaches to the run already going, transcript and all. That is only
 * possible because the output buffer, status and error live here rather than
 * in component state, which a close would throw away.
 *
 * Two verbs, deliberately different:
 *   - close (the modal's X / Escape / backdrop) hides the console, run continues
 *   - cancel (the footer button) kills the command
 *
 * A run is keyed by operation + repo, so two agents on different worktrees can
 * push at the same time while a second Push on the SAME repo attaches instead
 * of racing a duplicate.
