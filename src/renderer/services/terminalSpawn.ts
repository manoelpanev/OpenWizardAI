/**
 * terminalSpawn.ts - the one place a terminal tab's PTY is started.
 *
 * This used to live inside `TerminalView`, which meant a tab only ever got a
 * shell if that component rendered it. `TerminalView` mounts per agent and only
 * for the agent that is (or has been) on screen, so a terminal opened into the
 * background never spawned at all: the tab appeared in the tab bar, `send-terminal`
 * answered "has no running shell yet", and the only cure was to click the tab -
 * exactly what `open-terminal --background` exists to avoid.
 *
 * The spawn itself never needed the view. It touches no DOM and no xterm
 * instance; it is an IPC call plus two store writes. So it lives here and both
 * callers share it (a caller that HAS a rendered terminal passes its measured
 * cols/rows in, but nothing here goes looking for them):
 *
 *   - `TerminalView`, when a tab it is rendering has no PID yet
 *   - the `open-terminal` remote handler, the moment it creates the tab
 *
 * Callers differ only in how they REPORT failure: the view can write into the
 * live xterm buffer, the handler cannot. That is the `onSpawnFailure` hook.

/**
 * Tabs with a spawn already in flight, keyed by the PROCESS id
 * (`getTerminalSessionId(sessionId, tabId)`), never by the bare tab id.
 *
 * Module scope rather than a component ref, because the two callers live in
 * different React subtrees and a per-mount guard cannot see the other's spawn -
 * a background spawn racing a user clicking that tab would start two PTYs and
 * orphan one with no error anywhere.
 *
 * The key must be the composed process id: tab ids are only unique within an
 * agent, so guarding on the bare id would make two different agents' terminals
 * dedupe each other and the second one would silently never start.
 *
 * This only covers the window before the PID lands in the store. Once it has,
 * `pid !== 0` is the durable guard and survives remounting.
