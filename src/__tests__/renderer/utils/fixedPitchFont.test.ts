/**
 * Tests for the font resolution every surface that shows shell text shares -
 * the terminal, the command-mode composer, and the shell command card.
 *
 * A terminal in a proportional font renders a broken grid: xterm sizes its cell
 * from the advance of `W` and then puts every character on that pitch, so narrow
 * letters trail a gap (`Cl aude`, `Mi crosoft`) while wide ones sit flush. The
 * DOM surfaces fail differently but for the same reason: columns of `ls -l`
 * stop lining up and box drawing stops joining.
 *
 * The advance numbers below are REAL, read out of the `hmtx` table of the font
 * files on the machine where this bug was found:
 *
 *   Avenir Next  W=1025  i=296  l=298  m=924   -> proportional (3.5x spread)
 *   Menlo        W=1233  i=1233 l=1233 m=1233  -> fixed pitch
 *
 * Avenir Next matters specifically because it was the configured `fontFamily`,
 * and it is a system font that resolves perfectly - so no amount of fallback
 * appending helps. It has to be measured and overridden.
