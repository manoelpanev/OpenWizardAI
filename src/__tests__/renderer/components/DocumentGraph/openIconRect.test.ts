/**
 * Where the open-file icon sits inside a document node.
 *
 * The renderer and the click hit test both call `openIconRect`, and that is the
 * whole point of the helper: when the two computed the rectangle separately the
 * clickable box sat a pixel above the drawn glyph, and turning previews off
 * would have moved the drawn icon to the middle of the pill while leaving the
 * hit box pinned to where a header band used to be. These tests pin the
 * geometry both callers share.
