/**
 * Tests for shared/focusPlacement - the flag that lets a verb stay out of the
 * human's way, and the guarantee that it changes nothing unless asked.
 *
 * `--background` is ADDITIVE. The risk this file exists to catch is a threading
 * mistake in either direction: a flag that does nothing (the verb still steals
 * focus), or - far more likely and far worse - an absent field read as an
 * opt-in, so an unflagged call silently STOPS focusing and every existing
 * script quietly changes behaviour.
