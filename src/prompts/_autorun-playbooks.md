## Auto Run Documents (aka Playbooks)

A **Playbook** is a collection of Auto Run documents - Markdown files with checkbox tasks (`- [ ]`) that Maestro's Auto Run engine executes sequentially via AI agents. The **Playbook Exchange** is an official repository of community and curated playbooks users can browse and import directly into their sessions.

When a user asks for a "playbook", "play book", "playbooks", "auto-run document", "autorun doc", or "auto run doc", follow the rules below exactly.

### Where to Write

Write all Auto Run documents to: `{{AUTORUN_FOLDER}}`

This folder may be outside your working directory (e.g., in a parent repository when you're in a worktree). That is intentional - always use this exact path.

### Authoring vs. Launching

These are two distinct actions and the user's phrasing tells you which (or both) they want:

- **Authoring only** ("create a playbook for…", "draft an auto-run doc"): write the Markdown file(s) to `{{AUTORUN_FOLDER}}` and stop. Then run `maestro-cli refresh-auto-run` so the document appears in the Auto Run panel.
- **Launching** ("…and run it", "kick it off", "start the auto run", "create and run X"): after writing the doc, **launch it via the CLI** so the Auto Run engine drives execution and the user can watch progress in the UI:

  ```bash
  {{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} auto-run <doc-path...> --launch --agent {{AGENT_ID}}
  ```

  Useful flags: `--save-as "<name>"` to register it as a reusable playbook, `--loop` / `--max-loops <n>` for iterative runs, `--prompt "<extra instructions>"` to prepend per-task guidance, `--reset-on-completion` to uncheck boxes when finished.

**Critical:** When the user asks you to _run_ an auto-run, do NOT execute the tasks yourself by reading the document and doing the work in this chat. That bypasses the Auto Run engine, leaves nothing in the UI, produces no playbook record, and loses the per-task fresh-context isolation that makes auto-runs reliable. Launching via `maestro-cli auto-run --launch` is the only correct path. Always pass `--agent {{AGENT_ID}}` so the run targets you (without it the CLI picks the first available agent).

### Playbook Type: Task-Based vs Document-Based

Every playbook runs in one of two fresh-context modes. **When you create a playbook, explicitly tell the user which type it is** (one line is enough) so they know how it will execute:

- **Task-based** - Maestro spawns a fresh agent for each `- [ ]` task, with no memory of previous tasks. Maximum isolation; every task must be fully self-contained (see Task Format below). This is the default and the right choice for most agents.
- **Document-based** - a single agent walks every task in the document in one continuous session, carrying context forward between tasks. Appropriate only for agents with very large context windows (≥1M tokens), where a whole document's worth of work fits in one context.

Maestro auto-selects the mode from the running agent's context window - document-based at ≥1M tokens, task-based below that - and the user can override it per run. Because a playbook may run either way, **always author self-contained tasks** (Task Format below); document-based execution is an optimization, not a license to write tasks that depend on chat memory. After you create a playbook, state its type plainly, e.g. _"Created a task-based playbook - each task runs in a fresh agent context."_

### File Naming

Use the format `PREFIX-XX.md` where `XX` is a zero-padded two-digit phase number (01, 02, ...). Zero-padding ensures correct lexicographic sorting.

- 1-2 phases: flat in the folder - `AUTH-REWRITE-01.md`, `AUTH-REWRITE-02.md`
- 3+ phases: dated subdirectory - `{{AUTORUN_FOLDER}}/YYYY-MM-DD-Auth-Rewrite/AUTH-REWRITE-01.md`

**Multi-phase rule:** For 3+ phase documents for a single effort, place them in one flat subdirectory directly under `{{AUTORUN_FOLDER}}`, prefixed with today's date. Do NOT create nested `project/feature/` directories - all phase documents for a given effort go into one folder.

### Task Format (MANDATORY)

**Every task MUST use `- [ ]` checkbox syntax.** The Auto Run engine only processes checkbox items. Prose paragraphs, numbered lists, code blocks, and headers are **completely invisible to the engine** - they are never executed.

**Common failure mode:** Writing detailed implementation steps as prose (headers, paragraphs, code snippets) and only using `- [ ]` for a validation checklist at the end. This produces documents where ZERO implementation work gets done - the engine skips to validation checks that all fail because nothing was built. **If the engine should do it, it MUST be a `- [ ]` checkbox.**

Each checkbox task runs in a **fresh agent context** with no memory of previous tasks. Tasks must be:

- **Self-contained**: Include all context needed (file paths, what to change, why)
- **Machine-executable**: An AI agent must be able to complete it without human help. If it needs a person, it is NOT a checkbox - see "Human Steps Must NEVER Be Checkboxes" below
- **Verifiable**: Clear success criteria (tests pass, lint clean, feature works)
- **Appropriately scoped**: 1-3 files, < 500 lines changed

Sub-bullets are allowed under a single `- [ ]` checkbox to describe compound work within one task:

```markdown
- [ ] Create authentication components in `src/auth/`:
  - `LoginForm.tsx` with validation
  - `RegisterForm.tsx` with error handling
  - `AuthContext.tsx` for state management
```

### Task Grouping Guidelines

**Group into one task** when: same file + same pattern, sequential dependencies, or shared understanding (e.g., fixing all type errors in one module).

**Split into separate tasks** when: unrelated concerns, different risk levels, independent verification needed, or the work mixes code/tests/test-runs (always separate these three).

### Human Steps Must NEVER Be Checkboxes (MANDATORY)

The Auto Run engine dispatches every `- [ ]` task to an AI agent. If the task needs a person, the agent cannot finish it, and one of two bad things happens: the run **stalls forever** waiting on someone who was never asked, or the agent **ticks a box for work it never did**. Both are worse than not writing the task at all.

Before you write any `- [ ]`, ask: _can an AI agent with shell, file, and network access finish this alone?_ If the answer is no, it is not a checkbox.

**Signals that a step is human-only.** If a task contains any of these, it must not be a checkbox:

- Manual action: "manually test", "by hand", "walk through the UI"
- Visual judgment: "visually verify", "confirm it looks right", "eyeball the layout", "check the animation feels smooth"
- Waiting on a person: "ask the user", "wait for the conductor", "confirm with the team"
- Approval gates: "get sign-off", "human review", "await approval before continuing"
- Credentials or accounts only a person can obtain: "sign up for an API key", "create a Stripe account", "request production access"
- Physical or out-of-band work: "plug in the device", "call the vendor", "deploy from the admin console"

**Two correct encodings** - pick by whether the run must stop:

1. **The run must pause here** - emit a HITL gate marker on its own line, immediately above the tasks that depend on the human:

   ```markdown
   - [ ] Build the checkout flow and deploy it to the staging environment.

   <!-- MAESTRO:HITL reason="Click through checkout on staging and confirm the payment step renders" artifact="https://staging.example.com/checkout" -->

   - [ ] Apply the fixes from the staging review, then run the checkout test suite.
   ```

   The engine pauses the run at that marker, surfaces the `reason` (and optional `artifact` to look at) in the Auto Run panel and a toast, and waits. The user resumes by checking the box above the marker or clicking Resume. This is a **deliberate, visible pause** - the opposite of a stall.

2. **The work just isn't the engine's job** - put it as plain `-` bullets under a trailing section. The engine never reads these, so they cannot stall anything:

   ```markdown
   ## Manual Follow-Up (not executed by Auto Run)

   - Verify the dark mode toggle looks correct on a physical iPhone.
   - Get design sign-off on the new empty state.
   ```

**Wrong:**

```markdown
- [ ] Manually test the login flow in the browser and confirm it looks right
- [ ] Get approval from the team before proceeding
- [ ] Sign up for a SendGrid account and add the API key to .env
```

**Right:**

```markdown
- [ ] Add Playwright coverage for the login flow in `e2e/login.spec.ts` (happy path, wrong password, locked account) and run `npm run e2e` until green.

<!-- MAESTRO:HITL reason="Add SENDGRID_API_KEY to .env before the mailer tasks run" -->

- [ ] Wire the SendGrid transport in `src/mail/transport.ts` using `process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY` and add a unit test that mocks the client.

## Manual Follow-Up (not executed by Auto Run)

- Get design sign-off on the new login screen.
```

A stale HITL marker left above an unchecked task will pause every re-run until the box above it is checked, so use gates only where a person genuinely must act.

### Token Efficiency

Each `- [ ]` task starts a fresh AI context and receives the entire document. This is token-heavy, so favor grouping related operations and separating unrelated work.

### Model Tier and Effort

A playbook rarely wants one setting end to end. Surveying a codebase is cheap mechanical work; designing the migration that follows is not. A marker sets the model tier and the effort level, at whichever scope fits:

```markdown
<!-- MAESTRO:MODEL tier="low" effort="low" -->

- [ ] Catalogue every call site of the auth middleware
- [ ] Summarize the current request flow
- [ ] Design the migration <!-- MAESTRO:MODEL tier="high" effort="high" -->
- [ ] Apply the mechanical renames
```

Two placements, and the placement IS the scope:

| Placement                 | Scope                                                     |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| On its own line           | Applies from there down, until the next standalone marker |
| At the end of a task line | Applies to that ONE task; the next task reverts           |

Put a standalone marker above the first task and it governs the whole document. Put one under a section heading and it governs that phase. Put an inline marker on a single task and only that task is affected - in the example above, "Apply the mechanical renames" runs back at `low`/`low`, not at `high`/`high`.

Both attributes take `low`, `medium`, or `high`, and both are optional. The two scopes layer **per axis**: an inline marker that sets only `tier` keeps the prevailing `effort`. Use `tier="default"` (or `effort="default"`) to push one axis back to the agent's own configuration - that is how a single expensive-looking task opts out of a document-wide hint.

A marker should also carry a `reason` justifying the choice - at most three sentences, plain text, with no double quotes inside the value:

```markdown
<!-- MAESTRO:MODEL tier="low" effort="low" reason="This phase only catalogues what already exists. Reading and listing call sites needs no judgment, so the cheap model at low effort is enough." -->
```

Explain what makes the work hard or mechanical rather than restating the levels. The reason has no effect on the run; Maestro shows it behind an ⓘ on the marker's pill so a reader can audit the judgment.

The rules that matter when authoring:

- **`low`/`medium`/`high` are ladder POSITIONS, not literal provider values.** `high` means the ceiling of whatever that provider offers, so on Claude Code `effort="high"` becomes `max`, not `high`. Never write a provider-specific value here.
- **`tier` and `effort` are different axes.** `tier` picks which model; `effort` picks how hard it thinks. A low tier at high effort is a sensible request.
- **Not every provider can honor a tier.** Model tiers ship for Claude Code and Factory Droid; Codex, Copilot-CLI, and OpenCode discover their catalogues at runtime, so a tier hint there falls back to the agent's configured model and logs a warning. Effort works everywhere except OpenCode, which has no effort setting.
- **Markers inside fenced code blocks are ignored**, so a playbook can document this syntax (as above) without changing its own behavior.

Reach for a hint when a task's cost and its difficulty are genuinely mismatched - a document-wide `low` with a couple of inline `high` tasks is the common shape, and it is usually cheaper than the default. Omit markers entirely when the whole playbook wants one setting; the agent's own configuration is then used, which is the right default.

Per-task synopses always run at the cheapest model and lowest effort regardless of what the task ran at. They summarize work that already happened, so they never need the expensive model, and there is nothing to configure.

### Early Exit (Halt Marker)

A running agent can abort the entire Auto Run mid-playbook by writing the marker `<!-- maestro:halt: reason here -->` (or bare `<!-- maestro:halt -->`) into the current document. When the engine sees this marker after a task, it stops dispatch immediately - no further tasks in the current document, no further documents in the playbook. The optional reason is recorded in the History panel and emitted to the JSONL stream as a `halt` event.

**When AUTHORING a playbook, never write a bare halt marker into it.** The marker is not a conditional - it does not mean "stop if this check fails", it means "this run has stopped". A document that ships one is a document that refuses to start, and because an HTML comment renders as nothing, the user sees a playbook that will not go with no visible cause. This is the single most common way an authored playbook arrives broken.

The default Auto Run prompt already tells executing agents that the option exists and when to use it (true playbook-wide blockers, not ordinary task failures), so you usually need not mention it at all. When you do want to name a halt-worthy condition, write the condition in plain words - "If the build is already broken before you start, halt the playbook and say so" - and if you must show the literal syntax, put it in backticks or a fenced code block. Markers inside inline code, inside a fence, or riding a `- [ ]` checkbox line are read as examples and ignored; a marker standing alone in the document body is obeyed.

A stale halt marker left in a document blocks re-runs with an error naming the file and line - the user must remove it before the playbook will start again.

### Structured Output Artifacts

When the effort produces documentation, research, notes, or knowledge artifacts (not just code), instruct agents to create **structured Markdown files** with:

- **YAML front matter** for metadata (type, title, tags, created date)
- **Wiki-links** (`[[Document-Name]]`) to connect related documents
- **Logical folder organization** by entity type or domain

This enables exploration via Maestro's DocGraph viewer and tools like Obsidian.

### Example Auto Run Document

```markdown
# Auth Rewrite Phase 1: Database Schema

- [ ] Create a new `auth_sessions` table migration in `src/db/migrations/` with columns: `id` (UUID primary key), `user_id` (foreign key to users), `token_hash` (varchar 64), `expires_at` (timestamp), `created_at` (timestamp). Run the migration and verify it applies cleanly.

- [ ] Update `src/models/Session.ts` to use the new `auth_sessions` table instead of the legacy `sessions` table. Update the `findByToken` and `create` methods. Ensure existing tests in `src/__tests__/models/Session.test.ts` still pass, updating them if the interface changed.

- [ ] Add rate limiting to `src/routes/auth.ts` login endpoint: max 5 attempts per IP per 15 minutes using the existing `rateLimiter` utility in `src/middleware/`. Add tests for the rate limit behavior.
```

**Note:** Nudge messages configured on an agent do not apply to Auto Run tasks - they are only appended to interactive user messages.
