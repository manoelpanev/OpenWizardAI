## Onboarding Wizard

The wizard (`src/renderer/components/Wizard/`) guides new users through first-run setup, creating AI agents with Auto Run documents.

### Wizard Flow

1. **Agent Selection** → Select available AI (Claude Code, etc.). The name is OPTIONAL
2. **Directory Selection** → Choose project folder, validates Git repo status. Also fills the agent name and offers "skip the playbook"
3. **Conversation** → With files in the folder the AGENT opens; otherwise it asks a clarifying question. Builds a confidence score (0-100)
4. **Phase Review** → View/edit generated Phase 1 document, choose to start tour

When confidence reaches 80+ and agent signals "ready", user proceeds to Phase Review where Auto Run documents are generated and saved to `.maestro/playbooks/initiation/`. The `initiation/` subfolder keeps wizard-generated documents separate from user-created playbooks.

#### Agent name vs project name (issue #1225)

They used to be one string, so naming an agent put that name in the discovery
prompt as `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` ("Hello Maestro" for a project called something
else). `shared/projectIdentity.ts` splits them:

- `projectNameFromPath()` - the PROJECT, always the folder. Every
  `startConversation` / `generateDocuments` call uses this.
- `defaultAgentNameForPath()` - the Left Bar label, deduplicated against
  existing agent names because `validateNewSession` rejects a duplicate
  outright. `useAutoAgentName` applies it on the directory step and only
  overwrites a blank name or one it wrote itself.

Step 1 therefore no longer requires a name to proceed (`canProceedToNext`).

#### Who speaks first

`useWizardOpeningKind` decides, and `sendOpeningMessage(kind)` sends it:

| Folder state                   | Opening                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Existing playbooks, "continue" | `existing-docs` - agent summarizes the current plan          |
| Has files                      | `survey` - agent reads the project and reports what it found |
| Empty (or the read failed)     | None. The canned `getInitialQuestion()` bubble, as before    |

"Has files" comes from `projectHasFiles()`, which ignores `.git`, `.DS_Store`
and editor folders - `git init` alone is not a project.

#### Which model plans

The discovery turns and the document generation both spawn with
`sessionCustomModel: state.plannerModel`. Undefined means the agent's own
configured model applies (`applyAgentConfigOverrides`), which is the default.
`PlannerModelBar` shows the resolved model on the conversation and generation
screens and offers the provider's top tier where `resolveTierModel` knows one.
The override is scoped to the wizard run and is deliberately NOT copied onto
the created agent.

#### Skipping the playbook

`useSkipPlaybookLaunch` calls the same `onLaunchSession` the final step uses,
with no generated documents. It must set `autoRunMode: 'none'` first or the
launch swings the Right Bar to Auto Run for a playbook that does not exist. It
writes no wizard-run stat: `recordCompletedWizardRun` files zero documents as
`outcome: 'abandoned'`, which a deliberate skip is not.

### Triggering the Wizard

```typescript
// From anywhere with useWizard hook
const { openWizard } = useWizard();
openWizard();

// Keyboard shortcut (default)
Cmd + Shift + N; // Opens wizard

// Also available in:
// - Command K menu: "New Agent Wizard"
// - Hamburger menu: "New Agent Wizard"
```

### State Persistence (Resume)

Wizard state persists to `wizardResumeState` in settings when user advances past step 1. The next time the wizard is OPENED (`openWizardModal` in `App.tsx`, not app launch - nothing checks resume state at startup), incomplete state produces `WizardResumeModal`, which offers "Resume" or "Start Fresh".

```typescript
// Check for saved state
const hasState = await hasResumeState();

// Load saved state
const savedState = await loadResumeState();

// Clear saved state
clearResumeState();
```

#### State Lifecycle

The Wizard maintains two types of state:

1. **In-Memory State** (React `useReducer`)
   - Managed in `WizardContext.tsx`
   - Includes: `currentStep`, `isOpen`, `isComplete`, conversation history, etc.
   - Lives only during the app session
   - Must be reset when opening wizard after completion

2. **Persisted State** (Settings)
   - Stored in `wizardResumeState` via `window.maestro.settings`
   - Enables resume functionality across app restarts
   - Automatically saved when advancing past step 1
   - Cleared on completion or when user chooses "Just Quit"

**State Save Triggers:**

- Auto-save: When `currentStep` changes (step > 1) - `WizardContext.tsx` useEffect with `saveResumeState()`
- Manual save: User clicks "Save & Exit" - `MaestroWizard.tsx` `handleConfirmExit()`

**State Clear Triggers:**

- Wizard completion: `App.tsx` wizard completion handler + `WizardContext.tsx` `COMPLETE_WIZARD` action
- User quits: "Quit without saving" button - `MaestroWizard.tsx` `handleQuitWithoutSaving()`
- User starts fresh: "Start Fresh" in resume modal - `App.tsx` resume handlers

**Opening Wizard Logic:**
The `openWizard()` function in `WizardContext.tsx` handles state initialization:

```typescript
// If previous wizard was completed, reset in-memory state first
if (state.isComplete === true) {
	dispatch({ type: 'RESET_WIZARD' }); // Clear stale state
}
dispatch({ type: 'OPEN_WIZARD' }); // Show wizard UI
```

This ensures:

- **Fresh starts**: Completed wizards don't contaminate new runs
- **Resume works**: Abandoned wizards (isComplete: false) preserve state
- **No race conditions**: Persisted state is checked after wizard opens

**Important:** The persisted state and in-memory state are independent. Clearing one doesn't automatically clear the other. Both must be managed correctly to prevent state contamination (see Issue #89).

### Tour System

The tour highlights UI elements with spotlight cutouts:

```typescript
// Add data-tour attribute to spotlight elements
<div data-tour="autorun-panel">...</div>

// Tour steps defined in tourSteps.ts
{
  id: 'autorun-panel',
  title: 'Auto Run in Action',
  description: '...',
  selector: '[data-tour="autorun-panel"]',
  position: 'left',  // tooltip position
  uiActions: [       // UI state changes before spotlight
    { type: 'setRightTab', value: 'autorun' },
  ],
}
```

## Inline Wizard (`/wizard`)

The Inline Wizard creates Auto Run Playbook documents from within an existing agent. Unlike the full-screen Onboarding Wizard above, it runs inside a single tab.

### Prerequisites

- Auto Run document folder must be configured for the agent
- If not set, `/wizard` errors with instructions to configure it

### User Flow

1. **Start**: Type `/wizard` in any AI tab → tab enters wizard mode
2. **Conversation**: Back-and-forth with agent, confidence gauge builds (0-100%)
3. **Generation**: At 80%+ confidence, generates docs (Austin Facts shown, cancellable)
4. **Completion**: Tab returns to normal with preserved context, docs in unique subfolder

### Key Behaviors

- Multiple wizards can run in different tabs simultaneously
- Wizard state is **per-tab** (`AITab.wizardState`), not per-agent
- Documents written to unique subfolder under playbooks folder (e.g., `.maestro/playbooks/project-name/`)
- Tab starts on the `Wizard` placeholder, then auto-names itself `wizard: {Topic}`
  from the `/wizard <input>` argument or the first message typed into it
  (`requestWizardTabAutoName` in `src/renderer/services/tabAutoNaming.ts`). The
  placeholder counts as unnamed; a tab the user renamed by hand is left alone
- On completion, tab renamed to the generated subfolder name
- Final AI message summarizes generated docs and next steps
- Same `agentSessionId` preserved for context continuity
- **Escape is a ladder, not a single action.** Mid-turn it stops the running turn
  and stays in the wizard (same as a regular AI tab); idle with user messages it
  opens the exit confirmation; idle with none it leaves wizard mode. The mid-turn
  branch must return early: during the first turn the conversation still looks
  untouched, which is how one Escape used to destroy the whole wizard tab while
  the agent was running. The composer shows a Stop button in place of Send for
  the same reason - a keyboard-only exit strands anyone on a tablet or remote
  desktop.
- **`/wizard` runs in place**, so the untouched-wizard branch only closes the tab
  when the host tab has no non-`system` log entries. Otherwise a wizard started
  in a tab with a real conversation would throw that conversation away.

### Leaving wizard mode never destroys the conversation

The wizard conversation lives ONLY in `wizardState.conversationHistory`, rendered
by `WizardConversationView`. `tab.logs` (what `TerminalOutput` renders) is a
different store and the wizard never writes to it while it runs. So clearing
`wizardState` deletes the whole conversation and hands the user an empty tab.

Every exit therefore goes through `flattenWizardIntoTab(tab, { summary? })` in
`src/renderer/utils/tabHelpers.ts`, which appends the transcript to `tab.logs`,
promotes `wizardState.agentSessionId` onto `tab.agentSessionId` so the plain tab
can keep talking to the same provider context, and only then drops the wizard.
**Never write `wizardState: undefined` by hand.** The three exits:

| Exit                                       | Handler                              | Closing entry                     |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Wizard completes                           | `completeWizardImpl`                 | "Wizard Complete" + next steps    |
| Exit Wizard button / cancel doc generation | `handleExitWizard`                   | one-line "conversation preserved" |
| App restart                                | restart sweep in `useWizardHandlers` | one-line "did not survive"        |

The restart case exists because `tab.wizardState` persists to disk but
`useInlineWizard`'s `tabStates` map does not, so every wizard tab present at load
is stale. The sweep runs once when `sessionsLoaded` flips true and covers EVERY
tab in EVERY agent - the per-tab sync effect only ever looks at the active tab,
so relying on it left background wizard tabs showing a dead wizard until clicked.

Closing the wizard TAB is the deliberate exception: it warns the user first and
passes `skipHistory`, and the tab is going away regardless. `WizardExitConfirmDialog`
takes a `willCloseTab` prop for exactly this reason - it must not promise the
user their progress is lost when the in-place path keeps it.

### Which wizard is running: one source of truth

`useInlineWizard`'s internal `tabStates` map is the authority on what is running.
`AITab.wizardState` is a **render mirror** of it, and the sync effect in
`useWizardHandlers` only writes the ACTIVE tab, so the mirror drifts both ways: a
wizard started on a background tab has none, and a wizard that ends while its tab
is in the background keeps a stale one. Read activity from
`useInlineWizardContext().wizardActiveTabs` (or `useWizardActiveTabs()`, the
non-throwing variant for leaf surfaces rendered outside the provider); read
`wizardState` only for the conversation content the mirror exists to render.

Two rules follow:

1. **Always name the tab.** `endWizard`, `sendMessage`, `cancelTurn`, and
   `generateDocuments` all fall back to the hook's `currentTabId`, which tracks the
   LAST-TOUCHED wizard, not the visible one. Ending the wrong tab leaves the visible
   wizard registered on a tab that has already dropped its state, with nothing left
   that can clear it. Watch for `onClick={onCancel}` in particular: it type-checks
   against a `() => void` prop and then hands React's click event in as the tab id.
2. **An agent-level indicator must be rolled up through
   `rollUpWizardActivityToSessions()`** (`src/renderer/utils/wizardActivity.ts`),
   which drops any tab that is no longer open. Every path that removes a tab (close,
   close-all, snooze, agent delete) has to remember to evict its wizard entry; the
   liveness filter is what stops one that forgets from burning a wand into the Left
   Bar for an agent with no wizard tab to switch to.
